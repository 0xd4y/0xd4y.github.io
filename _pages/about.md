![Beach Chess]({{site.baseurl}}/images/beach_chess.jpg#center)

Thanks for visiting my website! My name is Segev Eliezer. I first started learning cybersecurity in January 2016 and instantly fell in love with it. My passion for chess gave me a big headstart in the cybersecurity field, as I already possessed the abilities to focus under pressure, think critically, and problem solve. Since then I have penetrated and secured over 200 machines (some of these engagements are posted on this website).

Additionally, I led and created a cybersecurity team (ZeroToHero) from the ground up, and used my experience teaching to mentor my team members to a level of cybersecurity proficiency. It was the most rewarding thing to see my team collectively grow from winning 20% of competitions to 80%, and it was only possible due to the support and respect that my team members and I had for one another.

I initially created this website because I felt overwhelmed when first getting into cybersecurity, and I want to give back to the cybersecurity community and help guide learners such as yourself to a level of cybersecurity professionalism. Therefore, I write my reports and create videos in a detailed manner so that students can learn as much as possible without feeling lost.

I am a team player and open-minded individual who is looking to learn as much as possible. Please <a href="https://0xd4y.com/contact/">contact</a> me if you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or would simply like to reach out!
