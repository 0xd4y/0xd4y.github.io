modified SWF file to the server response 17 49   Playing our hacked version of Swords and Sandals 2 hello everybody this is xerox d4y and i ll be showing you how to hack any flash player game uh one of the games that i used to play a lot was this game called swords and sandals two played it about like 10 years ago all the time and i used to go on this website called hacked games where you could just get any kind of uh perk that you wanted for free and just get like like as if whenever you had a skill point you could just increase your skill points and not have any kind of repercussions of doing that and i ve always wanted to know how that kind of thing is done and um i recently figured out how to do stuff like that and i wanted to show it to all of you so uh one of the things that you ll need to perform this kind of um hack is burp suite so this is the burp suite tool this is one of the tools you re going to need it s completely free i ll put a download link in the description another link is this decompiler you ll need that because you re going to be decompiling swf files i ll get into that later it sounds complicated but it s not complicated so this is one of the other tools that you re going to need and for that specific tool you re going to need this file called playerglobal swc um this playerglobal swc file is going to be put into this program right here you just gotta go to settings click on advanced settings and then click on paths and wherever you downloaded that playerglobal swc file you just put that in right here by first clicking on this folder navigating to and then you put it in there i just downloaded this one the 15 0 because that just corresponds to this version of jpegs s i ll also put this in the description and this is just the download link for this jpegs s thing so everything is free you can easily download it and do it yourself okay so here s this game swords and sandals 2  i ll just first show you how it looks before you hack it and then i ll show you after i ll put chapters in this video so if you don t want to see how it looks before you can just skip so anyways i m gonna play the game here so it s loading the game info and that s actually an important part that we re going to be intercepting later  Music  okay uh then we just click play create new gladiator we have nine skill points to start out with every time we increase our skill we get one less skill point okay let s just put it all in strength um and just click check to start the game so there s all this intro it s not that important you fight this guy called fearful prisoner then you just kind of defeat him uh look um at the fact that we start with 30 health points and 110 mana so uh when we hack this game we re going to want to start off with more points than that and maybe even start off with a higher level than just level one so we defeated him we received 2500 gold and we re now level two and we get four skill points to put into our skill sheet so we just increase it there press check and day one glorious freedom uh an important thing to note is don t do any of this stuff uh you know if it s illegal what i m showing you right now is completely legal and it should not be used for any kind of illegal purposes anyways uh so let s go to this uh armory we can just get a breastplate uh note how when we hover over this item it says on the top left there this item is demo locked so somehow the game is realizing that this is just the demo version and because of that it s not letting us buy stuff like this or you know anything that s really good and that looks kind of cool it s not letting us buy it okay so that s just kind of how the game looks like you uh have an arena you have stats and all of that look at how we re level two we have 126 out of 480 experience and we re five six 180 pounds all right we can change all of that quite easily uh so first thing we re gonna have to do is clear the cache and the reason that s important is because right now in our cache is the swf file and all that stands for is um small web format and it s just an adobe flash file that was used for a whole bunch of flash games like this one uh so what we re gonna want is to modify it to make us instantly like level 50 or something okay so uh we go to our cache click on preferences uh then i ll just type in cash over here and here we are clear data i m going to clear all of this and just before i refresh this page i want to intercept it using foxy proxy so i m going to want to turn on burp suite um this is also another like really nice extension to have on mozilla firefox you just um install it using the extension um navigator thing on on firefox so you can just click on options and add your your own uh there s a lot of you know blogs uh and videos on how to set up foxy proxy in burp suite so i will not go over that uh okay so um let s put on actually before we do that before we do that we cleared the cache so let s just reload the page here now before clicking on play game because remember after we click on play game that s when sw the swf file is served let s intercept it let s put uh our burp suite on so that all of the traffic goes through port 8080 which i configured to be burp suite uh i ll turn on intercept to intercept any kind of responses and i ll click on play game so after clicking on play game we re performing a get request on this file w dot w asm it s not that important now we just click on forward and this is the swf file that we were talking about so it s 29 swf so now a really important part is because we re doing all of this client side it s important to intercept the response to this quest because we re going to be performing a get request to get this swf file so after we click forward the server is sending us the swf file so this is where we want to intercept that response here is the compiled swf file this is it all of this so what i m going to do is copy this to a file i ll call it sandals 2 swf and i ll save it and i ll go here and there it is there s the sandals swf if we do a files on this it says that it s just data and then the reason it s data and not seen as some kind of special swf file is because of all of this data here is where the swf file starts so let s delete all of this until we get to that part okay here we go uh now if you perform the same command on it it will say that it s a macrometer flash data okay so now we re going to put this into jpex s file open sandals2 swf  Music  okay so now it s decompiled uh when hacking any kind of flash player game you re going to get the script kind of folder and this is where the real meat of the game is this is what you re going to want to be looking for uh so there s all these different buttons uh remember this check mark button that was in the game well there s many different check mark buttons in the game depending on what kind of function it does there s one for buying an item there s one for just saying yes or no to uh what kind of name you want um so let s look at like what these buttons do we press on what happens when you release so this is a button for game over whenever you die there s this check mark button you click on it game over your characters erased and whatnot now here s the 720 button and with uh hacking video games you just got to be really persistent looking at all of these different buttons seeing what looks really nice the 720 button is interesting in particular because we have a leveled up function here and it tells us what happens whenever we level up so when we level up we go from level one to level two because of this plus one here well let s not wait until we level up let s go straight to level 50 or level let s say level 49 right below 50  um let s go straight to level 49 that way we don t have to wait till we level up and here is the variable for your level okay so let s just put that straight up here at the start we click on edit action script and let s put it right here root game hero level let s make us level 49  um yeah that looks pretty good all right let s just save this okay um let s look at some other buttons i m just going down here to look at so many more buttons here s another check uh here s a plus which if you remember in the character sheet this is what our skill points were about and whenever we hit that plus our strength went up by one but our skill points went from i think we started at nine then it went to eight and every single time we press the plus we got less and less points that s because of this minus equals if we change that to plus equals then instead of losing a skill point every single time we click on that plus button we instead gain a skill point and how about instead of gaining just one strength we gain 100 that would be fun okay let s do that um see we got a minus that s not that interesting another plus what s this other plus about well this other plus is about our agility our speed uh okay i ll just put i ll just do the same thing and i mean you could do the same thing for all of these different skill points it s i ve done it before and i will send a link on in the description as well of my github which will have the hacked version of the swf and it will have something like this for every single skill i m not going to show in this video but you get the idea how to do it you just go here click on plus change that and so forth so okay we have that um another thing if you remember there was a demo thing we couldn t buy armor because it was part of we re we re in a demo and we don t have the full version so what we can do is click on tools text search and let s see where in this code is this demo where is it saying that we are in demo mode so these are all the different places in the code where the word demo appears i ve already done this before so i can tell you that here is really where it s saying that we are in demo mode we are in global gamemode demo you can see like here for example uh where is it ah here bubble tech sorry friend the tournament name is locked in the demo version if tournament number and global name equals demo uh okay so what does it look like in the full version of the game let s see what where that might appear if if global game mode is a demo equals demo then that s just demo mode but what is the full version what s the word that we use for that so i m just gonna go here and see where it says something like fool um there we go global game mode equals full so we verified that whenever we put global game mode equals full that that means full version okay so let s just go back here and let s change this word to full edit action script and type in full okay let s see what else uh so we changed the strength um let s see what where we can put gold because we started off with think like 2500 something like that so let s find where gold is so let s do this type in gold and we see tons of different options let s click on this one and here is our gold uh this is the variable root game hero gold pieces is the variable that we re looking for and um let s just give ourselves a ton of money so we saw that 720 is where the game kind of starts uh so let s just put right here at the start of the game um one three three seven one three three seven gold so now when we start the game we should have that much gold okay um and i think that that looks good um i don t know if i want to do anything else  Music  i think this was also an interesting button uh you need to distribute all of your skill points before continuing let s change step points greater than zero to i don t know something huge so we never get that text okay i think that s good let s just uh save this here then what we ll do is this request instead of having this compiled by a compiled swf running on our client side let s have our hacked version so to do that i m going to just cut this using ctrl x i m going to delete everything here paste back what i cut and click on paste from file first i right clicked on burp suite then clicked on paste from file and then click sales2 swf and it s just loading here because i think it was like a two megabyte file or something like that okay let s forward this and turn off intercept you don t need to intercept anything anymore and let s see if our hack worked let s see if it worked so create new gladiator okay as soon as we clicked strength we gained a hundred strength and we gained a skill point okay so now we re so big that our head isn t even on the screen um same thing here gains a hundred and anyways you could do the same thing with the tag defense all of that um okay let s just i ll put the rest right here let s just go here oh this is just the intro again we it says we re level one which means our other code did not get executed yet but we start off with 170 health instead of i think it was 110 before or something like that and we just did 603 damage on that person uh we have leveled up to level 50  okay and now uh doesn t show how much gold you have if you go to the armory we have one three three seven one three three seven gold and let s see if we re still in demo mode we are not because when we hover over this it no longer says we have to be in demo mode to buy this so we can now buy cool looking armor now let s buy this one okay well there s that that was easy okay so um you get the idea so you could do this with any kind of flash game i know that flash games are not really served anymore because of their vulnerabilities like in 2011 alone there were 63 vulnerabilities there s also buffalo overflow vulnerabilities some rce which is remote code execution vulnerabilities that s the worst and there s also denial of service attacks all kinds of different attacks that were performed due to vulnerabilities of adobe flash but in any case as you can see that doesn t mean it s dead that there s no more swf files served by servers anymore the it could even work within emulators which is what i demonstrated here so anyways thank you for watching remember don t do anything illegal and yeah thanks for watching this video bye
